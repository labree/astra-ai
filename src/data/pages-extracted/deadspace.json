Squads bypass deadspace restrictions - anyone in your squad can warp towards your location.\nMissions\nMission sites are accepted from an agent at a Field Office. They can only ever be accessed by your player, and disappear once complete and you leave.\nAncient Structures\nIf you have an Ancient Beacon and navigate to the correct system, a deadspace Ancient Structure is generated. No other player can warp to this unless they are in your squad.\nAberrations\nAny normally warpable aberration will become a deadspace site after all crates are looted or asteroids are mined. Leaving a looted aberration will make it disappear from your map, but users still inside will remain there.",
