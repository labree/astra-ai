  "full_text": "This is a page I made for people to just type out suggestions and ideas the game could have. (Whether it’s in development or on/not on the roadmap) \n\nThe tutorial worked during its prime, but obviously it needs things to be added or changed.\nmissing some a lot of things, so maybe y’all can contribute to it too.\nSome things to be considered are:\nWarship Mechanics.\nImproved beginner and Intermediate ship editing\nA clearer guide to certain things like anomalies,aberrations, warp points\nProbe scanning and “CTRL/Z” MENU guide.(the pop up menu is incomplete so just probe scanning for now)\nLearning to Identify station modules(repair bays,docking clamps, spice platforms etc)\n—OPTIONAL STUFF—\nAn AI Assistant or some sort of mascot to guide through the tutorial\nAn introduction that talks briefly about the rise of cloning technology, warp drives efficient to do daily tasks, being able to start off where you left off(indirectly saying that your going to be respawning),basically a more detailed introduction.\n\nThis is an idea for a challenging or difficult PVE location which requires ATLEAST 2 destroyers or 1 destroyer with 2-3 frigates. These hideouts would not be found in warp hubs or rings, rather in Deadspace. You would need to acquire a “Locator Beacon” that spawns sometimes from large den wrecks. Using this, you would have to equip it onto a planet probe which will then detect an unknown abberation. After warping to this abberation, an acceleration gate is present which you will use to get your ship launched at high speeds until it slows down near a pirate outpost around the planet. This outpost would be a mixture of pirate dens, different types of dens not found in regular ones and unique structures.\nPirate Hideouts would essentially be a cluster of pirate dens, with various structures and multiple ships guarding it.\nStructures:\nTurret Platforms\nTier 3/Occasionally Dread Turrets installed on small asteroids or platforms. Some of these can be destroyed without destroying shielded structures.\nCommunication Beacon\nThese work similarly to the structure on drone battleships which alert enemy escort ships to your location.\nIf you hack this, you can receive an amount of LP or Standing and credits. This cannot be destroyed until at least 2 medium dens are destroyed.\nDisruption field generator\nThis creates a warp disruption field similar to a warp disruptor. There are 2 generators.\nWhen both are intact, you cannot warp/lightcruise, but when only one is intact, you can lightcruise out.\nDestroying both will allow the player to exit the area and to anomalies/hubs/other areas.\nThe first one can be destroyed after destroyed 2 small dens. The second one when you destroy a few more structures.\nData/Storage Units\nThese are separate structures which may or may not spawn, and require hacking puzzles to be useful.\nThese contain databanks/chips which can be used as skill injectors to further improve your skills.\nCoreSec/Standing items can be recovered that can be given for standing and LP respectively.\nLess useful/Common Dread-tier items can be recovered.\nShip Maintenance Depot\nDestroying this small depot will give you some portions of common and slightly rarer materials.\nHow it would be is that there are a few small,medium and large dens connected with each other with various structural beams and details. Some of these other dens can’t be damaged unless the reactors and shield generators go down first. Afterwards the structures will be destroyed in a one-by-one manner or destroying some portions, moving to the other and then killing both of them to further damage others. This suggestion is a bit unclear,rough and wild, but i am working on refining it and making it more tolerable.\n\nRight now, the only thing we have to a capital ship boss fight is the drone battleship. these would be for the factions.\nideas:\nA large battleship that could be found in contested. it is essentially a drone battleship but for the factions, and would be found on offence instead of defence.\nA capital ship that does not respawn when killed but is immensly hard to do so, and tries to warp out when it takes a lot of damage. each faction would only have one, and they would warp around looking for trouble in their respective territory.\nPermenant system raids. these would be immensly hard, and simply make the system unsecure/wild for a while, but could have multiple stages and good loot with each one. they would be more difficult depending on their security class, however, with core being near impossible and unsecure being like a normal contested stronghold.\nother ideas:\nPirate headquarters, like a pirate den but even bigger\nvenexium guardians can be bigger, this would be more difficult to kill and maybe even justify crusiers for player use\nArena gamemode, where you have access to all ships for free but its only for PVP",
