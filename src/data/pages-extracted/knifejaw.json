  "full_text": "Knifejaw\n\"The Knifejaw corvette is a solid and versatile warship. The Foralkan Armada makes extensive use of it in small, agile attack fleets.\"\nThe Knifejaw is a corvette-class ship of the Foralkan ship line. It is best suited as a brawling ship due to its tank and damage.\nAdvantages\nThe Knifejaw has high HP and damage due to its role bonuses, and its turret placement can shoot 360 degrees vertically, making it a good brawling ship that can circle around its target.However, It has low shields. As a Foralkan ship, any weaponry equipped on it will be augmented by its bonus. This is also the highest damaging corvette according to raw damage dealt without any modules.\nDisadvantages\nThe Knifejaw has a hull focus, restricting its methods of retreating into station for players with less confidence. In addition its turret placement is strange for inexperienced players to pick up.\nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\n- The current Knifejaw is modeled by ii_Cove.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nMegalodon Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nMackeral\nPiranha\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nSunfish\nPtychodus\nT2\nCandiru\nThresher\nExotic",
