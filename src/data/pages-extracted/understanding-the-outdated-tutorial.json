  "full_text": "Understanding the Outdated Tutorial\nThis page, hopes to give the outdated and poor tutorial a better reputation despite how it potentially is, and to fix what it lacks and does bad at.\nTouring the Citadel.\nThe tutorial should probably bring you around the citadel, giving short descriptions for each room before starting off.\n—What its good at.—\nTeaches basic mechanics that arguably, isn’t actually too lacking and bad, teaches you how to warp, mine,refine and a few more things.\n—What it lacks.—\nThe tutorial still mentions the use of crafting or buying probes, which is impossible due to a game-changing update in January 8th 2022, revamping the game in some form, making probes infinite,free.\nIt also does not give a proper head start or doesn’t even do that, for the ship editing section, where you should be taught how to edit the ship, and learn more about how the Modifications or Module System works. This is due to the developer yet to add a portion in the tutorial about this.\nThe CTRL/COMMAND button menu for ships doesn’t get shown in the tutorial, however this is due to the dev yet to change the tutorial or add something to introduce people to this mechanic.\n—Combat Tutorial-LACKING.—\nThe combat tutorial makes you shoot a few drones, get something related to that done, and calls it a day, however, it doesn’t make you engage with a NPC ship that isn’t a drone. It also doesn’t refer to use subs systems to gain an advantage or turn the tide of a fight.\nIt could be revamped to give you a “Civilian” Tier module”(In EVE, civilian tier modules are bad, only to be used for learning or doing missions or activities to introduce you to certain items) that you use against a NPC ship that also uses a subsystem, teach you how to use it and take control of what the opponent is being affected from, after a good few minutes, it will conclude by making you and the NPC do a fight with both of you using 1-2 subsystems against each other and for yourself.\n—Scanning Anomalies and Unknown Coordinate/Signatures.—\nBecause other sub-variants of anomalies like aberrations have been introduced, it should teach you how to scan and go to a coordinate in 3-Dimensional Space. \nI will add more to these categories when i find more information. \nConclusion:\nHopefully, by reading this thing entirely word for word, you might or may have become to be more forgiving to the abandoned, outdated tutorial, know why its in this state and understand its 30% potential on introducing certain things, and have an idea of what you, the player can do to suggest a change to improve.",
