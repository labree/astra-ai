  "full_text": "FAQ\n\nStarting Out\n\nHow do I get started?\nStarscape is an open-universe game, with many different paths for the new player. You can read Getting Started for more information.\nCan I buy things in this game for Robux?\nNo, you cannot. Resources, materials, and other in-game items cannot be purchased for Robux. However, cosmetics can be purchased through the premium currency Stardust, which can be bought with Robux. These cosmetics give no in-game advantages.\nWhat is the best way to earn money as a new player?\nThe main in-game currency is credits. The most efficient credit-making methods require expensive combat/industrial ships which you will likely not have. To get started, you should do missions for NPC factions or loot X-Structures. Later, you can haul, mine, hunt drones, capture systems for an NPC faction, and engage in piracy when you have the necessary ships.\nHow do I get to the player marketplace?\nGo to the yellow market terminals, and go to the Marketplace tab at the top. There is a separate Player Market for every system. The most popular one is at the Citadel.\nHow do I get missions?\nMany stations have Field Offices, where you can receive missions from NPC agents. You'll need a certain number of reputation points to receive high-tier missions, but Tier 0 missions do not require any. Use the Agent Finder tool in the Galaxy Map to find agents of the NPC Faction and tier you want.\nWhat do I do if I die?\nDeath is a normal part of the game, and there's always a way to recover. Accept it, learn how to avoid it in the future, and work to rebuild the ship you lost.\nI died! Why can't I spawn my ship again?\nIf you died in wild space, your ship is gone forever. If you died somewhere else, you must wait for the salvage timer to finish, or pay to recover your ship immediately.\nHow do I edit my ship/install upgrades?\nWalk over to your spawned ship and press C on the grey ship indicator. Here, you can select which upgrades you want to install. Only warships like corvettes and frigates can equip Size-S turrets, and only destroyers (except for the Horizon) can equip Size-M turrets.\nHow can I repair my ship's hull?\n \nSome stations will have antenna-like structures on the side of them, called Repair Bays. Stop your ship next to them and it will regenerate your hull for no cost. The Citadel has one on the lower level. \nWill I find a lot of Vexnium in Gatinsir?\nNo. Gatinsir is a piracy hotspot. Even if you have a powerful ship, you will likely be killed by the large numbers of pirates there. Vexnium can only spawn in VX anomalies in wild systems. Telling new players to go travel to Gatinsir is a common prank for experienced players. Other hotspots for PvP and pirating, which should be avoided, are Emas, Stoyd Ydase, Eod'taost, Cid Tapa, and Vlasium. \nHow do I sell/upgrade my ship?\nIn the docking bay, select the ship you wish to sell/upgrade. Then hit \"Repackage\" under the \"Spawn\" button. The ship will be placed into your inventory, and all your modules, subsystems, and turrets (if any) will be returned to you. You can then go to the manufacturing module to upgrade your ship or sell it on the player marketplace.\nMining, Hauling, & Exploring\n\nHow do I find an anomaly?\nAnomalies can be found using a system probe. Deploying a system probe will open up the system map, and start a minigame where you must guide the probe with your mouse to find anomalies. When the probe is close to an anomaly, it will beep faster and change color (blue → turquoise → green → yellow → red). Anomalies do not spawn in core systems, and can only rarely be found in secure systems. They are most common in wild space.\nAre there any hidden system locations? How do I know what's in the one I'm warping into?\nFor system anomalies, see here.\nFor planetary aberrations, see here.\nWhere do I find valuable ores?\nThe best way to find valuable ores are heading out to wild space and using Scanning Probes to find anomalies, which are hidden areas in a system. Look for the A-type anomalies in the above list to find standard ores. \nWhat is the best system to mine in?\nThere is not (and probably never will be) a \"best\" system to mine in. System anomalies are randomly generated, but the further into deep space you go, the more likely you are to encounter an abundance in rare resources such as Axnit, Narcor, and Red Narcor. While Wild systems offer the best loot tables out of all the systems, it carries many serious risks, especially if you don't pay attention to your environment. Because most people head right for the edge of space, you would be best off going to about midwilds.\nHow often do anomalies reset?\nThere is no definitive time in which anomalies reset, however Wormholes (WH) will despawn either 2 days or 2 weeks after first contact, and Syndicate Frontier Outposts (FO) will have visible timers on the interior. Most other anomalies last about 24-48 hours.\nHow do I get skins for my ship?\nSkins can be obtained from gaining high NPC faction standing or Military Ranking with an NPC faction, being in a Tier 3 player faction, or buying from the Robux shop.\nHow do you get higher-tier items?\nCommand-tier drones and other drone structures have a chance of dropping Hybrid upgrades. Dread-tier pirate NPCs and Pirate Dens have a chance of dropping Dread upgrades. X-Structures, particularly the intact station at the location marked on an Ancient Beacon, contain Ancient upgrades. Ancient upgrades, Dread upgrades, and Hybrid upgrades are all equal in power to each other.\nCombat\n\nWhat can you do with Drone Factories?\nDrone factories can be destroyed for loot, although they can have high health depending on their level. To destroy the factory, you must destroy the shield generators and the power regulators to make its main reactor damageable. Then destroy it to blow up the factory and obtain loot.\nWhat is the purpose of weapons and armor?\nWeapons and Armor can be used in ground station battles in unsecure stations and FO anomalies. They can be sold or bought in Syndicate Frontier Outposts, Freighters, Weapon Dealers/General markets, or the player marketplace.\nWhat is the best fighting ship?\nThere is no \"best\" combat ship, as each has its own situation where it can perform better than others. To start fighting drones and doing missions, you will probably want a Sabre. Regarding warships, Kavani warships like the Judicator and Conciliator are popular because of their reputation as well-rounded ships, and the Lycentian Justice and neutral Bulwark have good turret placements.\nWhat is the best NPC faction in the game?\nThere isn't objectively one, but you may benefit from enlisting in one over the others depending on your playstyle. Factions offer unique ship blueprints. Kavani invest in technology, so their ships have more subsystems. Foralkans invest in firepower, leading to extra turrets or bonus damage. Lycentians invest in stability, thus giving them shield tanks. Neutral factions like CoreSec, Trade Union, and the Syndicate give other benefits for players that don't engage in combat. The Trade Union specializes in hauler capacity and the Syndicate specializes in stealth.\nCommunity and Updates\n\nHow do I join a player faction?\nEither the leader of the faction or a recruiter has to invite you. If you want to join a specific faction, you should ask a member to get you invited.\nWhat is the point in joining player factions?\nRapid progression through the game, a generally safer experience, and another level of content if you join the factions that engage in fleet combat/faction warfare.\nWhen will the next data wipe be?\nWhen the game comes out of beta and is fully released; that is, likely never.\nWhen are player stations coming out?\nAt first, they were planned to be released after Tech Week, on July 12, 2020, but were delayed, then cancelled. A second iteration was planned for December 2021 as part of the Roblox Accelerator Project. They were also delayed, then cancelled. Another player station update was planned for June 2022. They were eventually cancelled as well.\nCan we land on planets?\nNo you cannot. Keth did prototype world generation early in development, but it took too long to load to be practical. If Roblox ever gets a better system, it is possible. As for now, though, planet landing is not possible.\nGame Features and Mechanics\n\nWhat is spectral class?\nSpectral class is the color of the main star in the system. The spectral class filter should be used when attempting to match an Ancient Beacon inscription to the Galactic Map. For real information on this topic, see this page. \nWhat are power cells used for?\nAs of right now power cells are only used for certain very high tier items. If you don't intend on manufacturing any semi-endgame equipment, you can sell them for some extra cash.\nWhat is the best ship in the game?\nThere is no such thing as a \"best\" ship, but some ships are more efficient and effective in their roles then other ships. The ship that requires the most resources to craft is the Yukon miner.\nWiki\n\nIs there an official wiki for this game?\nNo, this community-maintained wiki is the closest thing. However there are a few other unofficial sources of in-game information. There are a few unofficial Discord servers as well.\nAm I allowed to advertise my faction on the wiki?\nTrade and Faction are available categories in the discussion boards to advertise whatever. If they don't fall under those two categories just straight advertising is not allowed. However if, let's say create a informative video detailing a good way to get credits and want to share it with people in the general topic, that is fine. Advertising in the actual wiki though is off limits, no questions asked.\nI really want to start editing but I'm not sure how to, where can I get help?\nIt's not hard to jump in and edit. Mimic what you see other \"established users\" doing. If you need some more help use the editing guide and ask on the discussion boards. Also check staff requests and the wiki discussion board to see if there is something people want specifically done. Always make sure that the information you add is true, not just likely or your opinion.",
