  "full_text": "Eos\n\"The Eos is a combined miner-hauler developed by the Trade Union. It is primarily intended for long-term unsupported mining expeditions.\"\nThe Eos is a miner-class ship of the Koronis line. It is best suited as a cheap but capable long-distance mining warship.\nAdvantages\nThe Eos features 4 cargo slots, keeping in line with the Mining Guild line's focus on space. As such, it can take longer trips into wild space before requiring a station to store its loot. As with most mining warships, it has a role bonus which makes it more efficient at mining than fighter-style miners. Due to its cargo capacity combined with its relatively low cost, the Eos is a powerful miner when it comes to wild space expeditions.\nDisadvantages\nAs a miner, it is less agile than other ships of its class. Its cargo crates make it a juicy target for player pirates hoping for a large loot haul, and it does not boast much in the way of combat capabilities - it has less hitpoints compared to other corvettes and rigs mostly focused on industry, not combat. It also does not have any designated combat or self-defense slots, and most of its turrets are focused on maximum mining power.\nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\nThe current Eos is modeled by swindle150 and ii_Cove.\nPrior to the Getting Around update, this was a Trade Union ship. Its description still claims it was developed by the Trade Union.\nMiners\nLine\nT1\nT2\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nBadger\nBadger\nHoney Badger\nMarlin\nMarlin\nMako\nEverest\nOzark\nKodiak\nYukon\nEos\nKoronis\nEos\nVesta",
