  "full_text": "Combat\nCombat in Starscape is divided into two main categories, PVE and PVP. There are different types of PVE and PVP, which will be listed below.\nPVE\nPVE is a popular way of getting income within the Starscape community. It consists of attacking Drone and Pirate NPC's for their loot and selling it on the marketplace, along with military faction NPC's and generating income from their loot.\nNPC Hunting (Drone/Pirate)\nDrones and pirates are found throughout the Galaxy, making them easy to find. You can scan a system with a system probe and find threats on different planets. Drones can be found in Drone fleets and Drone factories, while pirates are found in Pirate Dens. You can attack these NPC's for their loot and sell it on the marketplace, although some hunters keep a portion of useful items to upgrade their ships for more efficient hunting.\nFaction NPC Hunting (Foralkan/Lycentian/Kavani)\nThe less preferred method of PVE, this is also a way of generating income (albeit less efficient). Players will search Contested systems for Faction Fleets and destroy them for credits if the player is already in an NPC faction along with their loot. This is generally not recommended and is used when the player manages to stumble across one of them.\nPVP\nPVP in Starscape is common and mostly takes place in PVP enabled areas (Unsecure and Wild systems). These take the form of Ship combat, Faction Warfare, Piracy, and Ground combat. PVP in general isn't a good source of income.\nShip Combat\nThe most common type of PVP, ship combat consists of two or more parties attempting to destroy each other, whether for the loot or for the pure thrill of it. While it can be a source of income, it is not stable and is not advised.\nFaction Warfare\nThis consists of players attempting to capture Contested systems for their affiliated NPC faction, and blends a bit of PVE to it as there are NPC guards. This happens regularly, and can take forms of a single player taking the system alone or in grand battles that are engraved into history. Very fun, but not a stable source of income.\nPiracy\nNot to be confused with the NPC pirates, player piracy is when a player in a combat ship ransoms a player in an economic ship (often a hauler or a miner) for their survival in ores or credits. If the economic player refuses, or the pirating player deems the ransom not to be enough, the hauler or miner usually gets destroyed. Not amazing income for the pirate, but decent. \nGround Combat\nThe rarest form of PVP, ground combat is when two or more parties engage each other in a station equipped with handheld weapons and armor. Often taking forms of great battles with massive casualties, they are a source of fun PVP. Generally not a good source of income due to the rare chances of these occurring. Gatinsir is often a popular spot for these battles.",
