  "full_text": "Encounters\n\nOverview\nStarscape is a vast universe with a burgeoning player population and a developed economy. Many NPCs fill the game, with roles as patrols, hostiles, and portable markets. Many systems have different encounters, which are impermanent features that can either help or hinder the player's progress.\nHostile Encounters\n\nDrones\n\nFleets\nDrone Fleets have several variants, and are defeated by destroying the Command ship.\nFireteams, with two waves of Light drones up to Frigates and a Fighter or Interceptor Command ship, spawn in Secure space. This type of fleet is extremely weak and is easy to destroy with fighters.\nSquadrons, with three waves of Regular drones up to Frigates and either a Fighter, Interceptor, or Corvette Command ship can spawn in Secure, Contested, or Unsecure space. These Squadrons are significantly stronger then a fireteam, and a corvette is recommended for guaranteed survival.\nFleets can have a Corvette or Frigate Command ship, and they spawn in Contested, Unsecure, or Wild space. They consist of a mix of Regular, Advanced, and Elite drones up to Destroyers.\nArmadas can have a Frigate or Destroyer Command ship, and they only spawn in Wilds. They consist of a mix of Regular, Advanced, and Elite drones up to Destroyers.\nAfter an armada is defeated, namely, when the command ship is destroyed, there is a 10% chance of a Drone Battleship spawning. This is an incredibly powerful ship classified as a \"mini-boss.\" It has the ability to call in waves of Elite Drone Destroyers and Regular Drone Cruisers. Do not underestimate how fast it can warp into the system after killing the command ship.\nEach of these fleet variants is progressively more difficult, both with more waves and more dangerous enemies. Successfully defeating these fleets is rewarded with possibilities of rare materials such as Narcor and Red Narcor, as well as Hybrid Modules and Blueprints.\nFactories\nDrone Factories have several variants, and are destroyable by taking out the Shield Generators, then the Power Regulators, and then the Main Reactor. Every time a part is destroyed, other than the Main Reactor, a wave of defenders is called in. In addition, waves of defenders also warp in on a timer regardless of part destruction.\nDrone Depots spawn in Secure, Contested, and Unsecure space. They have one Shield Generator and one Power Regulator. Drone depots are protected by a force of fighters, interceptors, corvettes and turrets (stationary guns), a skilled player with a fighter could also destroy this, but a corvette is also recommended. There will be 2-4 waves of drone reinforcements, spawning up to frigates.\nDrone Foundries spawn in Secure, Contested, Unsecure, and Wild space. They have one Shield Generator and two Power Regulators. It is usually protected by advanced or elite variants of fighters, interceptors and corvettes. Advanced turrets are also present. A corvette is necessary for this undertaking. 3-4 waves of reinforcements are divided when the shield is destroyed, the first regulator being destroyed and the second one being destroyed. Advanced frigates have been known to spawn.\nDrone Factories spawn in Contested, Unsecure, and Wild space. They have two Shield Generators and four Power Regulators.\nDrone Megacomplexes spawn in Wild Space. They have four Shield Generators and six Power Regulators.\nEach of these factory variants is progressively more difficult, both with more parts to destroy and more dangerous enemies. Successfully destroying these structures is rewarded with possibilities of rare materials such as Narcor and Red Narcor, as well as Hybrid Modules and Blueprints.\nPirates\n\nDens\nPirate Dens have several variants, and are destroyable by taking out the Shield Generators, then the Power Regulators, then the Pirate Den itself. Every time a part is destroyed, other than the Main Reactor, a wave of defenders is called in. In addition, waves of defenders also warp in on a timer regardless of part destruction.\nSmall Pirate Dens spawn in Secure space. They have one Shield Generator and one Power Regulator.\nMedium Pirate Dens spawn in Secure, Contested, Unsecure, and Wild space. They have two Shield Generators and two Power Regulators.\nLarge Pirate Dens spawn in Contested, Unsecure, and Wild space. They have three Shield Generators and three Power Regulators.\nEach of these den variants is progressively more difficult, both with more parts to destroy and more dangerous enemies. Successfully destroying these structures is rewarded with possibilities of warship blueprints, Syndicate, CoreSec, and Trade Union standing items, as well as Dread Modules and Blueprints.\nFleets\nPirate Fleets occasionally spawn in Secure, Contested and Unsecure space. Sometimes they will be attacking a Generator, and sometimes they will just be wandering aimlessly, similar to Military Fleets. They rarely drop stolen artifacts crates, exotic goods crates or contraband weapons crates along with the more often credits, scraps or power cells, but they often drop nothing. Pirates originally had a very rare and exclusive drop but it’s no longer obtainable now that the Ethereal Pirate event has ended. They can consist of any pirate ship from Interceptors to Destroyers. Pirate Fleets come in fireteams, squadrons and fleets and are all defeated once the pirate command ship is destroyed.\nIt is possible to encounter both pirates and drones in the same warp hub that subsequently fight eachother, but only one side will have a fleet or structure in the warp hub. Note that if the planet has a ring it may be possible to have Drone presence in the ring with pirates in the warp hub.\nThreatening Encounters\n\nPlayers\nPlayers can be one of the most dangerous encounters in the game. Player encounters are only dangerous in Contested, Unsecure, and Wild space. In Contested Space, you only need to worry about players not enlisted in your military faction. \nYou might encounter a friendly victim miner, or you could stumble upon a decked-out player-pirate Destroyer who one-shots your new Ozark for fun. Generally, it is a good idea to leave that particular system when another player joins the server.\nMilitary Fleets\nNPC factions, such as the Foralkan Empire, Lycentian Federation, and the Kavani Mandate have many military fleets roaming systems. Military fleets can spawn in Secure, Contested, Unsecure, and Wild space, in groups as small as three fighters and a corvette all the way up to eight cruisers and numerous escorts. In secure space within the borders of a military faction, only their fleets spawn. In Contested Systems, fleets can be made up of the stronger Veteran, Ace, and Imperial ship variants.\nIn non-Contested space, these fleets are only dangerous if you have -1500 standing with their faction or if you open fire first. In Contested Space, they are only dangerous if you are enlisted with one of their enemy factions.\nPassive Encounters\n\nFreighters\nFreighters, either from the Trade Union or Syndicate, occasionally spawn in systems. They sell items for a fee of credits, often at a discount price to NPC markets. Trade Union freighters can spawn in Secure, Contested, and Unsecure systems, while Syndicate freighters can spawn in Contested, Unsecure, and Wild systems. Having high standing with the respective faction can grant you discounts. The freighters are destructible, and are attacked by Drones and NPC Pirates. They have a small chance of dropping their wares if successfully destroyed, and will attempt to warp away when the hull is damaged.",
