  "full_text": "Lycentian Federation\nThe Lycentian Federation is one of Starscape's three warring factions. It's primarily composed of unsecure territory, but still maintains about a third of its territories as secure, as with the other two warring factions. It is located on the north-east side of the map, bordering the Kavani Mandate and the Foralkan Empire. The federation consists of 2 permanently controlled regions: Catalyst and Sentinel. Catalyst hosts the capital of the nation, Lycentia. The slang term for this nation is \"Brick\" or \"Brickers\" because of the blocky build of their ships making them ressemble bricks.\nHistory\nThe Lycentian Federation is the oldest of the three major spacefaring civilizations of the galaxy. The two habitable worlds of Lycentia form the backbone of the galaxy's first major superpower and the only truly democratic nation. Border wars with the Kavani early in its history and more recent conflicts with the Foralkans have solidified the Federation against the two other superpowers. Though the Federation has stagnated in recent years, its enduring and its idealistic citizenry has withstood the test of time and are prepared to defend its storied homeland against any invaders, no matter the cost.\n-The known lore of the Federation, Starscape\nThe Lycentian Federation is the oldest of the 3 main powers in Starscape. It also has the most permanent systems between the 3 powers, showing their age in the galaxy. Judging by its huge number of Unsecure systems, it is reasonable to assume that the Federation got into a war before the start of the game, and most of its territory is unstable from external or internal causes.\nMilitary\nThe Lycentian military uses blocky and tanky warships and fighters. Their warship lines have a built-in turret agility buff which increases the turning rate of turrets. They use the Righteous warship class line. The Luster is the fighter class ship used by the Lycentians. It is compared to the Aurora line due to the high shield yields it has and ability to take plenty of punishment and damage. Their main naval force is the Lycentian (Or Federal) Starfleet, which uses the \"Federal\" tag. Their main choices of ships are those from the Righteous line and miscellaneous fighters, alongside the Dignity (Cruiser). They also utilize the Nobility, their main battleship class. The ship line they use sacrifices hull integrity with high shielding, which can counter pirate NPCs and kinetic energy weapons with ease.\nEnlisting\nPlayers can enlist in the Lycentian army by talking to a NPC in field offices who are located next to the terminal. Players can also enlist in contested systems by talking to a NPC that is located next to the terminal in the middle of the station or by talking to an ambassador at the Citadel. By enlisting, players will not be able to damage Lycentian NPC ships as well as other enlisted players in contested systems. Players can not resign from the army unless they have served for at least 24 hours. After resigning, if you wish to join back, you would return with a rank 1 lower than before.\nRanking Up\nTo rank up in the military, you must first be enlisted in the desired faction's military. When doing missions, as well as earning faction standing you also earn Loyalty Points, which can be used to buy faction items as well as rank up in the faction's military program.\nMilitary Ranks\nRank\nRequired Lp\nReward\nPLT\nEarned upon enlisting\nHoloprojector\nENS\n500 LP\nBanner\nLTN\n1000 LP\nSSLB\nLCM\n2000 LP\nLuster\nCMD\n3500 LP\nLucent\nCPT\n5500 LP\nLiberty\nCOM\n8000 LP\nVirtue\nADM\n12500 LP\nJustice\nStanding\nStanding is used to acquire Lycentian Federation rewards and titles. Standing is acquired from missions and standing items and can be checked by opening your inventory and going to the standing tab on the top bar. Missions are granted by agents in field office. As for the agent you need of your respective tier, they can be found using the Agent Finder on the map, on the top left. Higher tier agents require more standing to unlock but have a chance of giving missions that will give more standing. To access current active missions, players can go to the Missions tab on the top bar in their inventory.\nReputation items are items that can be turned in at Field Office terminals. The Lycentian Federation accepts reputation items from the Kavani Mandate and the Foralkan Empire. Reputation items can be found by killing NPCs of their respective faction, or by purchasing them from players.\nStanding Items\nStanding Items are the necessary bits of loot required to increase standing with each faction. Standing items can be turned in using a Lycentian terminal located in Lycentian field offices or talking to the Lycentian ambassador located at the Citadel. \nItem\nEffect\nKavani/Foralkan Insignia\n+7\nKavani/Foralkan Pilot Helmet\n+15\nKavani/Foralkan Mission Log\n+30\nAgent System Locations\nTier 0\nTier I\nTier II\nTier III\nTier IV\nTier V\nDromorom\nDromorom\nDromorom\nEarkod-abath\nAlthosoth\nAlthosoth\nEbalkea\nEbom\nEdsteazo\nEbalkea\nAnlu'jarter\nApacjit\nEbom\nEejveszad\nEsfita\nFi-te\nApacjit\nBriel'romeesp\nEejveszad\nEsfita\nHirem\nIned\nBetzadidi-6\nDives\nEsfita\nIned\nIned\nOalkoraez\nBriel'romeesp\nDropaek\nHirem\nLycentia (Lycentia Prime)\nLiraertex\nOdeluz\nDives\nGatbet'em\nHumet\nMoebmo\nLycentia (Tora)\nOnum\nOdio-ga\nHerbeehir\nLiraertex\nNerir\nOalkoraez\nOthinith\nGatbet'em\nIngoo\nLycentia (Lycentia Prime)\nOngloo\nOdeluz\nTau Osea\nHerbeehir\nJeomtglua\nPluodives\nPluodves\nOnum\nUfcid\nIalk En\nLopake\nTau Osea\nOospangrig\nIngoo\nMoko\nTo-elis\nOthinith\nIosas\nNerom\nPluodives\nIyius-gli\nOdio-ga\nTau Osea\nJeomtglua\nPreazad\nUfcid\nJites\nSirzocid\nLopake\nStake\nNerom\nTeacab\nOdio-ga\nTuithgroa\nOsiofeex\nVlaher\nOthoawan\nZoyoa\nPoluzher\nRigke\nRoalt Heruz\nStake\nStametast\nTeacab\nTuithgroa\nUlcluyx\nZoyoa\nRewards\nAs a military faction, the Lycentian Federation offers both regular standing rewards and military rewards.\nStanding Rewards\nItem Type\nItem\nTier\nDescription\nTitle\nI\nUnlocks equippable \"Lycentian Associate\" title.\nFurniture\nI\nCan now purchase a Lycentian Federation Banner at a Lycentian terminal for 50 loyalty points.\nFurniture\nI\nCan now purchase a Lycentian Federation Holoprojector at a Lycentian terminal for 25 loyalty points.\nUpgrade\nII\nCan now purchase a Lycentian Targeter II at a Lycentian terminal for 50 loyalty points.\nPerk\nIII\nDiscounts Lycentian warp relay jumps by 25%.

Additionally, players with -500 standing (Suspect) will not be allowed to enter Lycentian military stations.\nIn contested space, hangars part of the Federation will produce fighters to assist in the defense of the system. The AI is spread around to different structures, most commonly the Generator, and flies around it until a known threat is in the planet or system. When a pirate or enemy faction fleet, or a player of an opposing faction warps in, all ships built by the hangar and randomly generated fleets will warp towards the threat, attempting to eliminate or deter them.\nThe Lycentian Federation fires on any drones or NPC pirates that are in their targeting range, as well as ships from the Kavani Mandate and Foralkan Empire. They will also only take down faction generators in contested, but strangely not drone or pirate structures.",
