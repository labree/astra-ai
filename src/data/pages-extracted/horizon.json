  "full_text": "Horizon\n“The Horizon is unusually agile for a destroyer. While it sacrifices firepower and durability, it can run laps around other ships in its class.”\nThe Horizon is a destroyer-class ship of the Constellation ship line. It is best suited as a cheap but powerful sniper.\nAdvantages\nThe Horizon, like other Constellation-line ships, can warp and move quickly, allowing it to clear swathes of hostile space. Its small turret focus allows it to have more tracking and rate of fire than other destroyers. As expected, the Horizon performs best when away from the front lines. This mitigates its relatively small health pool. A common way to execute this is by outfitting the Horizon with railguns, so that it can still provide adequate fire support while taking little in return. Players should also use the Horizon in high risk scenarios, as it is relatively cheap to replace compared to other destroyers, whilst still being superior to lower-class ships. \nThe Horizon is the fastest destroyer, as well as the most agile. \nDisadvantages\nThe Horizon is the weakest destroyer, lacking in both damage and durability. It is outclassed in most roles, and cannot be used flexibly. Although it is a shield tank with good deflection, its health is still poor. It has no medium turrets, sacrificing them for more small turret slots. Because of these circumstances, it should not be played like a destroyer. Instead, play it as a frigate or even corvette with the right modules.\nTrivia\n- The current Horizon is modeled by DANNYBoy25000 and Jeff_D.\n- The current picture of the Horizon is outdated. The Horizon has a different model ingame compared to the item picture.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nConstellation Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nStratos\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nT2\nExotic",
