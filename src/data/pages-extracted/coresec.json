  "full_text": "CoreSec\nCoreSec (short for the Core Systems Security Operation) is a neutral body that maintains and patrols the galactic core. They are the first faction a new player is introduced to, being the one that controls the Citadel where all players start the game and respawn by default. Unlike the other capitals of other factions, there is no reputation requirement to have your spawn at the Citadel. They own a monopoly on cloning technology, and the revenue from these services is what funds their security forces.\nThe secure area they control is a good place for a player during the early game, as it has relatively weak NPC threats, other players cannot damage you or take your items, and the ores you find are sufficient enough to craft some of the basic ships (such as a Badger or Marlin for increased mining, or a Hyrax to begin hauling). However, Unsecure systems near the Core are usually quite dangerous, due to the presence of player pirates, multiple active pirate hotspots, proximity to faction warfare, and other factors. \nTheir security forces mainly focus on fighting Drones and sometimes Pirates, and they offer reputation if you turn in any Drone Cores or Pirate Standing Items. They are the only faction that does not have exclusive ship blueprints or other items besides cosmetics as faction rewards.\nMilitary\nCoreSec maintains a fleet of Peacekeeper ships that patrol the 6 core systems surrounding the Citadel. Peacekeepers can be from the Constellation, Stronghold, or Legionis lines. It is impossible to damage CoreSec defense fleets in the Inner Core, though destroying their transports and Covert Ops ships is possible with enough time. \nPolitics\nCoreSec highly stresses itself as a neutral entity, and prefers using diplomatic measures to ensure peace, rather than open warfare. CoreSec is presumably on friendly terms with all three warring factions and with the Trade Union and Mining Guild, as evidenced by the embassies and offices at the Citadel. CoreSec likely has a negative attitude, or at the very least, a minor hostility, towards the Syndicate, seeing as how John Doe, the Syndicate representative in the Citadel, is forced to hide behind a plant in order to, supposedly, avoid CoreSec authorities. The only entities CoreSec is actively hostile to are Drones and Pirates.\nStanding\nMain Article: Faction Standing\nFaction standing represents your relationship with each NPC faction. Completing missions or turning in certain items will increase your standing, while destroying their ships will lower your standing. Standing can be checked from the Career tab.\nStanding Items\nStanding items can be turned in using a CoreSec terminal located in CoreSec field offices. CoreSec has the same standing items as the Syndicate with the addition of drone cores. Their field offices can be found in any secure space, including that of other factions.\nItem\nEffect\nDrone Core\n+3\nAdv.

Higher tier agents require more standing to unlock, but have more difficult missions that give more standing. To access current active missions, go to the Missions tab on the top bar in the inventory.
