  "full_text": "Koronis\n\"The Koronis combines modest mining ability with the ability to haul cargo, allowing it to support itself on long-duration mining missions or take on multiple roles.\"\nThe Koronis is a miner-class ship of the Koronis Line. It is best suited as a fast mining ship for long expeditions.\nAdvantages\nThe Koronis is cheaper than warship miners, which allows it to try for more dangerous expeditions. With 2 cargo crates, and a good mix of weapon and engine rigs, it is a cheap but effective generalist miner.\nDisadvantages\nDespite being a fighter-style miner, it requires a blueprint to build, so most experienced players opt for a warship miner such as the Eos or Ozark instead. Much like other fighter-style miners, it is fragile.\nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\nThe current Koronis is modeled by Ocean_tsunamii.\nThe Koronis is the only ship whose blueprint can be acquired from more than one faction.\nMiners\nLine\nT1\nT2\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nBadger\nBadger\nHoney Badger\nMarlin\nMarlin\nMako\nEverest\nOzark\nKodiak\nYukon\nEos\nKoronis\nEos\nVesta",
