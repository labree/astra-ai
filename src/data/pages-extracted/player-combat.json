  "full_text": "Player Combat\nIn Unsecure, Contested and Wild systems, PvP combat is enabled, meaning that you can fight, kill, and be killed by other players. \nIn Secure and Core systems, you can send duel requests to other players. In duels, PvP is temporarily enabled until one side of the duel is left with only 1% health (ground duel) or 1 percent hull (ship duel). No health is regained instantly after duels. Enemy NPCs in the area, such as Drones or NPC Pirates, can easily finish you off, so it is recommended to only duel in Core Systems where no enemy NPCs spawn. (Over time, shields will still recharge and player health heals to 80%, like normal)\nContested System PvP is limited to players not enlisted in your NPC military faction. Two Lycentian players cannot fight in Contested space. However, a Foralkan player could fight a Kavani player, a Kavani player could fight an unaligned player, and two unaligned players could fight each other. No form of warp disruption is enabled in Contested Systems, making them the ideal place for casual PvP with little risk, assuming you have the tank and agility to warp away fast enough. Ground combat can be done on non-HQ stations, and space combat is done in space.\nUnsecure PvP is free-for-all. Any player, regardless of NPC faction affiliation, Player Faction affiliation, or Squad affiliation, can attack and kill one another. Friendly fire is always fully enabled. Warp Disruption Bubble deployables are not usable, but the Disruptor subsystem is usable. Most pirating takes place in Unsecure systems.\nWild PvP is also free-for-all. Any player, regardless of NPC faction affiliation, Player Faction affiliation, or Squad affiliation, can attack and kill one another. Friendly fire is always fully enabled. All forms of Warp Disruption are enabled. There is no insurance in Wild systems, meaning all ships and modules are permanently lost on death.\nAfter being killed, players drop a Player Tag bearing their username, which acts as a memento of the kill. You can view your player ship kills and deaths in the Combat Log section of the interface.",
