They are used in duels in secure systems and PvP within stations in unsecure systems and FO anomalies. As of right now, there are only two types of firearms: Pistols and Rifles. A player may only equip one of each. Firearms can be upgraded in the manufacturing area in stations. They can only be upgraded up to tier 3. Tier 4 weapons can only be purchased from Syndicate vendors. \n\nRifles are automatic weapons and are used by holding LMB. Firing for an extensive amount of time will overheat the weapon.

Simply grab one, challenge to duel, and start blasting; maybe even bet something if you're confident enough.\nDock Shredding - When a player is within a dock and within their ship, they are immune to taking fire from other ships until part of their ship is exposed out to space, where it can then be shot. However, if you have a gun, they can do a moderate amount of damage to a ship. When in a squad, if you have one or two ships prevent an enemy ship from docking, other members of the group can get out of their ships, and begin firing at the enemy ship with their pistols, doing moderate damage, but enough to cause panic and to potentially finish off a ship if they aren't able to adequately dock.\nRaids - Occasionally you will be in a scenario where you cannot fight in space combat against an enemy, and instead want to beat them on a more even playing field. A popular strategy for this is to rush Gatinsir station in a relatively cheap and quick fighter, and then get into the station in full armor, killing whoever is inside, stashing their loot, and then booking it.\nFor strategy, pistols when combined with an Autoclicker can be used for effective suppressive fire and enemy shredding. The other weapons are self-explanatory for strategy, but tend to be based around medium range and accuracy. There has been one instance in which someone has used an autoclicker and massive amounts of explosive grenades to destroy a Virtue frigate in a Docking Bay by spamming them. ",
