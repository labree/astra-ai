  "full_text": "Badger\n\"Seeing the need for higher rates of ore extraction, engineers improved upon the Otter design to create the more advanced and more capable Badger.\"\nThe Badger is an entry-level miner-class ship of an unknown ship line. It is best suited as a cheap starter mining ship.\nAdvantages\nThe Badger is cheap and can be bought at most NPC marketplaces, making it the ship of choice alongside the Marlin for new players. Compared to the Marlin, it has a faster mining rate but has difficulty escaping enemies.\nDisadvantages\nThe Badger is an entry-level ship, and thus will perform poorly compared to upgraded miners. Despite having a reasonable HP pool, it is slow and easy to catch, and lacks any combat abilities whatsoever.\nTrivia\n- The current Badger is modelled by AVeryDandyLad.\n- Before the Next Gen update, Badger was third in a line of 4 ships, including the Otter, the Otter mk II, the Badger, and the Honey Badger.
