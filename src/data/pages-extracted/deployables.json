  "full_text": "Deployables\nDeployables are able to be equipped in space or in a station, and launched from any ship, once outside of a station. There are currently 3 types of deployables that serve unique purposes in the game.\nList of Deployables\n \nSpacemines\nSpacemines are a type of deployable that when launched, place a mine in space, with a detonation radius shown by a transparent sphere around it. They can be detonated by being shot, or by entering the detonation radius. They can be found naturally in all systems except for Core and Secure systems. These see little to no use due to how they can be avoided in combat and wont affect the outcome as the weapons and modules on your ship gets the job done. \nHowever, these can be useful if your trying to destroy mainly low tier fodder ships like NPC interceptors , fighters or corvettes. \n \nWarp Disruptors\nWarp Disruptors are a type of deployable that when launched, place a disruptor in front of the users ship. When any ship besides the user enters the field, it will disable their Warp Drive, forcing them to leave the field or destroy the disruptor in order to warp. They have 3 tiers, each tier increasing their radius of effect and reducing activation delay. \n \nFireworks\nFireworks are a collectible type of deployable. When launched, fireworks fly for a short distance ahead of the ship before exploding in a ball of color. There are 7 colors of fireworks and a special snowflake firework, which create a snowflake-shaped explosion upon detonation. Fireworks serve no gameplay purpose.",
