  "full_text": "Factions\nFactions are a central aspect of Starscape, as you can get rewarded, or attacked, based on your reputation among the factions. Currently, there are six of these factions within the game, each listed below ;\nKavani Mandate\nForalkan Empire\nLycentian Federation\nCoreSec\nTrade Union\nSyndicate\nFaction Rewards\nEach faction shares a similar reward system, each maintaining mild differences here and there. Primarily, each faction can give three titles based on your standing, the names and required standings of which are as follows ;\nAssociate, Tier I\nAlly, Tier III\nHero, Tier V\nAs for faction unique rewards, the three primary factions (Kavani Mandate, Foralkan Empire, Lycentian Federation) each have a weapon unlockable at Tier II, followed by a ship at Tier IV. The trading factions (Syndicate, Trade Union) each provide discounts on their goods, starting at 10% off for Tier II, and an extra 15% off at Tier IV, for a total of 25% off. CoreSec has no unique rewards at this time.\nFaction Standing\nIn order to obtain those rewards, you must maintain a good standing with the faction whose rewards you want to get. Building it up is easy for factions like CoreSec, but for any of the Primary factions it can be a bit more decisive, as you'll likely need to target one faction to attain the items required to increase your standing in another. Essentially, you must attack ships of one faction, thereby losing standing, in order to get rewards from another. If you lose too much standing, getting to or below -1500, the faction's AI will automatically attack you when you come across them. Eventually, this low standing will also warrant the 'Enemy' title, which has not yet been added to the game.",
