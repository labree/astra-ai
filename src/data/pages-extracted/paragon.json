It is best suited as a fast scouting ship, and is the upgraded version of the Falcon.\nAdvantages\nThe Paragon is one of the most maneuverable ships in the game, only second to the Hybrid Paragon. This gives it unrivaled scouting abilities, and lets it escape from almost any situation. Its warp speed and charge time can be augmented to be one of the best in the game, second only to the Mako. It is preferred by player pirates for scouting ahead and pinning down ships for this reason.\nDisadvantages\nCompared to the other advanced fightercraft in the game, the Paragon has some of the weakest durability and DPS stats. This means that while the Paragon is excellent at going ahead of the fleet to conduct quick operations, it cannot complete more challenging tasks that other fightercraft could.\nTrivia\n- The current Paragon is modeled by Jeff_D.\nInterceptors\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nDefiance\nFalcon\nParagon\nHybrid Paragon\nValiance\nZenith\nPolaris\nHybrid Polaris\nMegalodon\nMackerel\nCandiru\nMandator\nParrot\nMacaw\nRighteous\nTetra\nTriazo\nDefiance Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nFalcon\nT2\nParagon\nExotic\nHybrid Paragon",
