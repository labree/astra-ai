They, along with R-deposits, are the only source of Vexnium, a rare and expensive material used in the construction of Destroyers and Hybrid Fighters. They contain 1-4 Vexnium asteroids, and 2-5 hibernating \"???\" Ships (unoffically referred to as Crystalline Guardians for their appearance and the description of their loot.) that guard the Vexnium. These ships are referred to in the game files as creatures known as the Acrisilex (This may not be the final name and could be changed later in development). The entire anomaly is filled with black clouds and cosmetic black and blue-spiked asteroids, and lightning flashes occasionally that does up to 500 Damage. \nUsage\n\nMechanics\nThe anomaly's Guardians are dormant until a player begins mining a Vexnium asteroid. The crystalline figures in the field will transform in shape and move about like ships, and fire bolts of energy in rounds of 3. They deal splash damage based on range up to ~600?/shot, with a maximum range of 5k, and have a recharge of about 5 seconds. \nTactics\nUse a ship that can either withstand the guardian's tremendous damage, or be able to repair the damage quickly. Use kinetic turrets in order to take advantage of the lack of shields, and make sure to equip a hull repairer. Don't forget to have at least a single mining turret equipped, in order to mine the Vexnium afterwards. \nRecommended armament if you are specifically going Vexnium hunting: all coilguns + 1 precision miner + hull repairer. A Precision miner is recommended so that you can collect almost all the ore automatically without having to chase it. Frigates and Destroyers of the Legionis and Mandator lines are recommended, although the Megalodon line's ships can be viable. Be careful with the Righteous line and repair the shield quickly, as the Guardians fire ion strikes which quickly damage shield.\nAnother tactic is to tank the Crystalline Guardians with a Yukon's hull while repairing it with a Hull Repairer, and mining the Vexnium ore as quickly as possible. \nA similar tactic to use: instead of quickly mining, the player can choose to take on the guardians with turrets such as a Coilgun Turret, and then proceed to mine the Vexnium. There isn't much incentive preferring this over the above mentioned tactic other than the fact that you get to keep some crystal shards, and mine the Vexnium at your own pace.\nAnother tactic you can employ is to mine the Vexnium ore while staying out of signal range of Crystalline Guardians. The mining turrets have a range of 2000 and staying at the maximum range of the mining turret will allow you to obtain the ore. This is possible because the signal range of Crystalline Guardians is 2000 as well so as long as you stay out of the signal range of Crystalline Guardians, they will not attack you, that is if you did not try to attack them. One potential flaw with such a method is that you will not be able to obtain some ores during the process, so ideally, using the Precision Miner Turret will maximize your gains.\nLoot\nThe Vexnium asteroids in the anomaly can only be mined with mining turrets. Using other turrets will display “No effect” at the impact point.\nThe Guardians in a VX anomaly drop Crystal Shards upon death. Their only use is as an apartment decoration or selling on the player market.\nThe other asteroids in the anomaly may be used as guardian cover, but have no other use. \nGallery\nA pair of dormant ??? shipsA dormant Crystalline GuardianA deceased \"???\" ship, with some defunct asteroids.A Vexnium Asteroid",
