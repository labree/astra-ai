Stardust has several more planned uses, including cybermods, exclusive outfits, and star-liners, which are collector ships that have very little armament, but can carry other players.\nWays of obtaining\nCurrently, there are 2 ways of obtaining stardust: either playing the game everyday to claim a daily reward of 5 stardust or purchasing some with robux. You will have to wait 23 hours and 30 minutes until the next daily reward. \nStardust Prices, in Robux:\n100 RBX: 100 Stardust\n475 RBX: 500 Stardust\n900 RBX: 1000 Stardust\n1700 RBX: 2000 Stardust\n4000 RBX: 5000 Stardust\nThe Stardust Shop\nThe Stardust Shop is where players spend their Stardust. It contains 5 tabs: Featured, Cosmetics, Starliners, Cybermods and Outfits. Only the Featured and Cosmetics tabs have content.\n \nFeaturedCosmeticsStarlinersCybermodsOutfits\nThis tab has 3 sections:\nThe Featured Bundle section where players can buy limited time bundles. As the Pirate Collection is currently the only bundle, it is permanently displayed here.\nThe Weekly Deals where cosmetics can be bought at a greater discount than daily deals and are reset every week.\nThe Daily Deals where cosmetics can be bought at a discount and are reset everyday.\nOn this tab, players can inspect all the purchasable ship cosmetics and purchase them at default price.
