  "full_text": "PvE\nPvE (Player vs. Environment) is the act of engaging NPCs (Non-Player Character) enemies in combat. Currently, there are NPCs representing each sovereign faction, as well as Drones, Pirates, and CoreSec. NPC shipwrecks contain loot depending on the NPC. This usually comes in the form of Junk (such as Scrap and Melted Power Cores), but can less commonly be more valuable loot such as upgrades or blueprints. \nDrone Combat\nDrones are the most common NPC in systems more dangerous than Secure, and considered to be the most profitable to hunt because of the high tier upgrades and blueprints their command and elite tier can drop. For more information, see Drone Hunting.\nPirate Combat\nPirates are more commonly found in the Core, and sometimes drop higher value loot, though drones currently are worth your time more than pirates are. Pirates can drop raw Materials, Turrets, Standing items, modifications and warmods, ship and turret blueprints (only dropped by pirate dens) and Junk. Most people hunting pirates search for pirate dens, as normal pirate ships rarely drop any valuable loot.\nPirates tend to have more health than a drone of the same class (which would mean a pirate corvette would be stronger than a drone corvette). Pirates are 5x weaker than the actual ship they represent, so a pirate frigate using a Phalanx would have 240 shields and 1500 health, which is quite tanky for an NPC. Additional Steeled variants are only half as weak, and Dread variants are equal to the ship it represents. There is also a glitch currently that makes PDT's actual turrets, which means the damage may be even higher than an actual player ship. Exercise caution; a large fleet of Dread Destroyers can easily kill even the most advanced ships.\nFaction Combat\nNPC Faction Ships can be found in faction territory and contested systems, except in the case of Trade Union and Syndicate freighters, which can be found in secure, unsecure and contested systems (TU) and unsecure, contested and wilds systems (Syndicate). Frontier Outposts throughout Wild Space also contain Syndicate Fighters and turrets. They drop Standing Items, Junk, and Turrets. Destroying a faction's NPC ships gives a standing penalty to the attacker. \nSome Contested HQ's can have ships of a Home world variant. These include Federal ships (Lycentian Federation), Imperial ships (Foralkan Star Empire), and Sovereign ships (Kavani Mandate). These ships are significantly stronger, with even destroyers struggling to take down a Homeworld cruiser. All faction Battleships spawn as their respective Homeworld variant.",
