  "full_text": "Piracy\nPiracy refers to the act ofattacking and destroying other player's ships.\nPirating is one of the main ways to make money in Starscape, the others being drone hunting, mining and hauling.\nPirates typically wait in the systems between Wilds and Secure space, waiting for explorers and miners, loaded down with riches, to come back from expeditions into wild space.\nPirates may occasionally request ransom instead of outright destroying your ship. In this case, you might as well give them items in your inventory, since they will be destroyed or stolen anyway if the pirate decides to murder you. Do not give them any credits, however, as they will likely just take them, then kill you and take your inventory anyway.\nThere are two different ways a pirate can disrupt their victim's warp drive: consumable Bubble Deployables, which only work in Wild Space, and reusable Disruptor subsystems, which work in both Wild and Unsecure space. \nPirating tips (for pirates):\nPiracy is not nearly as reliable or profitable as other methods, and is best done for sport and not as your main method of acquiring money. \nPiracy works best when camping common mining/hauling routes. Use fast, strong ships such as the Edict or Judicator. Have backup ships ready for if you die. \nAvoiding Pirates\nThe best way to prevent getting pirated is to simply avoid them. This includes not going to systems known to be crawling with pirates, like Gatinsir and Emas, warping away immediately when another person joins your server, and trusting no one whenever PVP-enabled systems are involved.\nA secondary way to avoid being pirated is to become a PvP master and always travel in a decked-out destroyer.",
