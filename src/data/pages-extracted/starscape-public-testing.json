  "full_text": "Starscape Public Testing\nStarscape Public Testing is an alternate version of Starscape where players can test new features before they are added to the main game. Expect bugs, instability, and poor balancing. It is always accessible despite being advertised as only open on weekends. A transparent red \"TEST SERVER\" banner is present at all times.\nThere are a number of differences from the normal game. Systems in the outer edge of wild space are disconnected from the rest of the galaxy and inaccessible, reducing the overall size of the galaxy. All Core systems aside from the Citadel are instead Secure. Most prices have been changed to be far lower; all items have an NPC sell price of 1 credit, and changing PDTs or hardpoints costs 1 credit. Stardust cannot be purchased, so the daily login reward is the only source of stardust.\nMost ships and items have been made available in shops and can be bought for only 2 credits, making it useful for testing out builds before investing in them in the main game. However, not everything is accessible. Staff-only ships like the Spectator are still impossible to obtain and all cosmetics are locked behind their normal unlock requirement.\nThe test server does not currently have any features in the testing phase. Only updates that require mass testing before deployment are added to the test server.",
