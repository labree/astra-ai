  "full_text": "X-Structures\nThis page is for a type of planetary aberration, for docking structures please see Structures.\n \nAn X-Structure is one of the two types of planetary aberrations in-game, found by launching a Planet Probe while you are in orbit of a planet with an undiscovered aberration. They can spawn in any system type other than Core, on any planet. \nThey consist of a derelict space structure with un-lootable ancient drone wrecks with 3-6 Hackable Crates hidden/placed around it. These crates can contain unrefined ores, materials, scrap, and, rarely in destroyed structures and guaranteed in intact X-Structures, contain ancient-tier items. In the rare Ancient Satellite Relay structure variant, the access panel gives you an Ancient Beacon. These structures will self-destruct after 10 seconds of looting it, which will not damage the player. Ancient Satellite Relays are only found in Wild space.\nIntact structures can only be found using Ancient Beacons, these structures are always at a random Wild system indicated by inspecting a beacon. The ancient relay satellite is an exception, being an intact structure that can be found rarely in regular aberrations.\nRegular X-Structures do not have enemies present, whereas intact X Aberrations have ancient drones.\nAfter an X-Structure is completely looted, it becomes deadspace.\nSize/Appearance\nStructures come in various different sizes, each with a unique amount of crates. The current biggest known structure has 5-6 crates per aberration. Ancient structures have 3-6 crates and contain extremely expensive loot. It is always recommended to try and solve a beacon rather than sell it as you can make upwards of hundreds of thousands of credits off of the loot. \nThe common thing in most structures is that there is a main “tower” that is found connecting to the main structure. The color scheme is mostly grey and brown, with rarely darker grey appearing. Most structures will always contain debris and wreckages of ancient drones. \nVariants\nThese are the known variants of the X-Structures in the game.\nSTORAGE BAY/HUB\nThis is a common, medium-sized structure. It has 3 containers and is the simplest in design among all the existing ones. It is a hollow structure, with “arms” extending upwards. This structure does not have an intact variant.\nSHIPYARD\nThis is a common, medium-sized structure. It has around 3-4 containers, and contains an wreckage of an usual ship not found anywhere else in-game. This structure does not have an intact variant.\nANCIENT RELAY SATELLITE\nThis is a unique and rarely occuring satellite that, when hacked, gives an ancient beacon. The structure self-destructs shortly after being looted. There are no debris fields or ancient drone wreckages around this structure, and only appears in regular X-Structure aberrations. Chances are approximately 0.25% to 0.2% to find\nSINGLE-RINGED STATION (Colossus)\nThis is a slightly larger structure that spawns mostly in X-Aberrations inside planetary rings. It's slightly more uncommon than other structures due to only spawning in rings. It has around 3-4 containers.\nDOUBLE-RINGED STATION (DualColossus)\nThis is a taller variant of the Colossus, with an additional ring and a lengthier tower. It has 4-5 containers and spawns less than its single-ring counterpart.\nLARGE SINGLE-RINGED STATION (Behemoth)\nThis is an incredibly large space station that can spawn uncommonly in planetary rings. It has 5-6 containers. The tower and ring itself appear to be much wider and elongated, with much more detail given to them. This structure appears larger than most X-Structures and other station/structures in game.\nTrivia\nThere is no information about the origin of these structures.\nThe wrecked ship in the shipyard structure appears to use docking ports, similar to destroyers, and also circular engines that current in-game ships use.\nVarious X-Structures have been reconstructed by starscape players, notable ones include variants which do not get an intact counterpart in-game. Below is a reconstruction of the wrecked ship created by slicing parts of the wreck and putting them together. In the gallery, 2 reconstructed variants can also be seen. \nGallery\nA structure inside wild space.A destroyed structure.A special satellite structure.An intact structure in wild space.Ancient drones protecting an intact ancient structure.
