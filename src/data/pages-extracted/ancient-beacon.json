  "full_text": "Ancient Beacons are items added in the Echoes of The Past update (6/3/21). They are found only in the Satellite X-Structure, found only in wild space. This site consists of an intact cruiser-sized satellite with a single locked access panel with the beacon. \nIn order to obtain the item, players must complete a small hacking minigame. If collected from the satellite, the structure will initiate a 10 second self destruct sequence, which does no damage to the player. When selecting an Ancient Beacon inside the inventory there will be an option to \"Inspect\" the beacon. \nInspecting the item will bring up a small picture of multi-coloured and connected dots, with a singular dot highlighted similar to inspecting a system on the galaxy map. This image corresponds with a random area on the map, the dot color representing a system's spectral class, AKA star color/heat. \nUpon exiting warp in the indicated system, a notice is given to the player: \n\nA structure aberration will then be revealed at a random planet in the system or an X-Structure Anomaly will spawn in the system. Entering this structure will reveal a station-like structure similar to the ones in normal X-Structures, but will be intact and active. A group of Ancient Drones defend the station. These drones have no shield, use kinetic weaponry, drop Ancient Drone Cores and are relatively weak. Once they are defeated, the player can hack numerous crates containing different resources, Ancient-tier modules, and Ancient-tier kinetic turrets.\nAn example of a beacon and its' corresponding system:\n \nExample of an intact X-structure found in the anomaly. This is only one of the few intact variants that can spawn.\nBeacons cannot be stolen - only the player with the beacon, and players in their squad, can access the location. However (while it is unlikely), people may try to camp the warp hub and pirate you. Best to keep your beacon to yourself.\nNOTICE: This is not a good place to post beacons you cannot solve. Try using the Starscape Beacons Game instead. ",
