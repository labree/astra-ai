  "full_text": "WH/FO Hauling\nWH/FO Hauling is a term used to describe the most advanced method of hauling currently available, and for good reason it is named. With a hauler and a few hours to burn, a lucky individual can gain millions of credits from practically nothing. WH/FO Hauling however is a very luck-based opportunity, which when directly searched for, will leave the user frustrated and potentially up to be pirated. If you travel with cargo it has a chance of being ruined and turned to scrap. This guide will help explore what this method of making money.\nThe Basics\nEveryone knows that going up to a Spice Platform with a hauler allows you to buy spice, and with that spice you can sell it at stations to make a profit, with the farther the station from the source, the higher the profit. There are 7 types of spice, which dictate what regions best to sell them in. The more you buy from a spice platform, the more expensive the spice becomes from that platform, with a similar decrease in profit coming from selling to the same station over and over again.\nWhat is a little less known but fairly common knowledge is Frontier Outpost anomalies (FOs) also sell spice, and in fact sell a special form of one of the 7 forms above, which is worth a little more then normal spice. This is often used for more adventurous routes from FO anomalies to stations, but is more a novelty then anything to write home about.\nWhat is interesting is the fact that FOs can also buy spice. You can sell spice to an FO similar to how you would sell to a station, with similar consequence. This is nice, but FOs nearby don't tend to have decent prices for spice; you want to sell to the highest price, after all. \nWhat gives this beautiful economic system its healthy dose of slightly broken is the fact another anomaly in the game also exists: the humble Wormhole (WH). While being generally convenient for nearly every case, a wormhole is specifically what turns this strategy into an inflation nightmare. \nThe Strategy\nIf you wish to participate in WH/FO Hauling, firstly you need to find a Wormhole. Wormholes are rare, being hard to come by, especially when you look for them. Wormholes also come in several grades, with some lasting mere hours, and others lasting weeks. Usually it is best to do normal activities, and only act upon a Wormhole if you happen to find one on your own, or hear reports from members of your faction of a Wormhole out in wild. The Wormhole should come from one side of the galaxy in far wild, and lead to another part of far wild. \nNext, on either end of the WH, searching far and wide, you want to mark down every FO you can within 10 jumps of the WH entrance for both sides. Write down system names, and what type of spice the FO is selling, along with their prices. With each FO you find on either side, you multiply the total number of sales you can make of a particular Spice.\nFinally, when you have everything marked up, get out your hauler (recommended that the hauler has turret slots) and start trading. Monitor prices and keep track as they increase and as sales decrease. Make sure you're always selling at a profit, for each station, and change which station you are buying from and selling to as necessary. By the end, you can expect several hundred thousand for just 2 FOs, much more with more FOs involved.\nWith long-lasting WHs, you can even wait for when anomalies reset to be able to get another batch, and repeat the process. This can result in millions of credits being made as long as you sink the initial time cost into it. On top of that, you even get to see what the FOs offer, which can range from completely useless to Blueprints for very cheap. All these factors mean you will be walking away with a lot of liquid capital, if you are lucky enough to get such a wormhole.",
