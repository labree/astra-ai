  "full_text": "Advanced Combat Interpretations\n\nIntroduction\nThis guide will focus on the different forms of combat. In PvP, skill or experience usually trumps loadout or ship. \nShips\nInterceptors\nInterceptors are fast, light ships with low firepower. They are best used for fast transport, due to their high warp speed, and with the right mods, pirating or skilled PvP. They have spinal hardpoints that can be Repeater, Pulse, or Chaingun. Repeater is generally the best, but Pulse can be used when range is needed. Chaingun is advised to not be used.\nThe Falcon-Paragon line consists of ultralight interceptors with high speed and agility with low health and low damage.\nThe Zenith-Polaris line consists of heavier interceptors with lower speed and agility, but higher health and damage.\nThe Kavani Interceptor line consists of the Macaw and Parrot they have high speed and agility, they also have more subsystems while having low health and damage.\nThe Lycentian Interceptor line consists of the Tetra and the Triazo have high speed and agility, but its shield is rather low, making it better at fleeing combat rather than actually fighting.\nThe Foralkan Interceptor line consists of Mackarel and Candiru have high speed, high damage, and agility but trade this out for lower hull and shields, which makes them less tanky then their counterparts.\nThey, as well as fighters, use S-size modules.\nAs part of a squad, they can be used to distract or disrupt an opponent, while they focus on the larger, more dangerous ships.\nFighters\nFighters are similar in size to interceptors, but slower and heavier. They are best used for early-game PvE and missions. With the right mods, fighters can be used for pirating or skilled PvP. They have spinal hardpoints that can be Repeater, Pulse, or Chaingun. Repeater is generally the best, but Pulse can be used when range is needed. Chaingun is advised to not be used.\nThe Aurora-Luminar line consists of shield-based fighters with medium speed, agility, health, and damage.\nThe Sabre-Claymore line consists of hull-based fighters with medium-low speed and agility, with high health and damage.\nThe Kavani Fighter line consists of the Toucan and Hornbill they have high speed and agility, they also have more subsystems while having low health and damage.\nThe Lycentian Fighter line consists of consists of the Luster and the Lucent have high speed and agility, but its shield is rather low, making it better at fleeing combat rather than actually fighting.\nThe Foralkan Fighter line consists of consists of Piranha and Thresher have high speed, high damage, and agility but trade this out for lower hull and shields, which makes them less tanky then their counterparts.\nThey, as well as interceptors, use S-size modules.\nAs part of a squad, they can be used to distract or disrupt an opponent, while they focus on the larger, more dangerous ships.\nCorvettes\nCorvettes are several times larger than fighters, and the different types can be used for a variety of purposes. Every combat corvette has 4 S-turret slots and 2 PDT slots. They are classified with frigates as warships, and use M-size modules. Corvettes can also work as an alternative to fighters and interceptors for piracy, due to their superior firepower and health.\nChevron is excellent for early-mid game PvE, including missions and some Drone Hunting.\nRadix is a corvette best suited early to mid game piracy or exploration due to its fast sublight and warp speed. On the other hand, its low hitpoints make it difficult to fight drones or enemy warships.\nInfinity is best suited as an upgrade of the radix due to its faster shield regeneration and better turret placement.\nKnifejaw is good for cheap support in fleet PvP, and it can be used for some early-game Drone Hunting and missions due to its high damage output.\nLiberty is a shield tank that can work for early-game missions and some Drone Hunting. Due to its very low speed, it should only be used if you do not have a frigate or destroyer.\nEdict is a powerful corvette with a moderate amount of speed and health. It's significantly higher health makes it superior to faster corvettes like Radix or Infinity. It also has an ample amount of combat rigs and subsystem slots which makes it arguably the best PvP corvette in the game. Furthermore, it can kite other ships.\nFrigates\nFrigates are larger than corvettes, and they have more health and firepower in exchange for less speed. Every frigate has 6 S-turrets and 4 PDTs. They are classified with corvettes as warships, and use M-size modules.\nPhalanx is excellent for midgame PvE, including wild Drone Hunting and missions.\nHalo should not be used, because it's design sacrifices a lot of health for a little bit of speed.\nAdamant should not be used, because it's design sacrifices a lot of health for a little bit of speed and regeneration.\nBarracuda is good for most midgame PvE, and it's high DPS makes it useful as a support ship in fleet combat.\nVirtue is a shield tank that can work for mid-game PvE and near-station PvP. Because ships are blocked from docking once they take hull damage, a shield tank like the Virtue can escape combat whenever it wants.\nJudicator is a powerful frigate with a moderate amount of speed and health. It's significantly higher health makes it superior to faster frigates like Halo or Adamant, and it's wide array of mod slots allows it to be as powerful of a PvE ship as the Phalanx.\nDestroyers\nDestroyers are larger than frigates, and they have more health and firepower in exchange for less speed. Different destroyers have different amounts of turrets. They are classified with cruisers as subcapitals, and use L-size modules.\nEchelon can be used as as a tank in fleets dealing moderate damage, though other than that, it should not be used, due to it mostly being a downgrade to the Bulwark for a more expensive price.\nBulwark is a slow, powerful hull tank. It is widely considered one of the best PvE ships in the game. It has 3 M-turrets, 3 S-turrets, and 2 PDTs.\nHorizon should not be used by unexperienced players, because it's design sacrifices a lot of health for a little bit of speed. It has 8 S-turrets and 2 PDTs. It is well suited for kiting in 1v1 combat scenarios.\nFortitude should not be used by unexperienced players, because it's design sacrifices a lot of health for a little bit of speed and regeneration. It has 2 M-turrets, 4 S-turrets, and 4 PDTs. It is well suited for kiting in 1v1 combat scenarios.\nLoxodon is a powerful destroyer with high damage and low-medium health. It can work for PvE, but where it truly shines is in FW and fleet PvP. It has 2 M-turrets, 6 S-turrets, and 2 PDTs.\nJustice is a shield tank that can work for late-game PvE and near-station PvP. Because ships are blocked from docking once they take hull damage, a shield tank like the Justice can escape combat whenever it wants. It has 2 M-turrets, 4 S-turrets, and 4 PDTs. Another advantage is that the justice is almost immune to coilguns - the most popular turret by far.\nConciliator is a powerful destroyer with a moderate amount of health and speed. It's significantly higher health makes it superior to other fast destroyers like Horizon or Fortitude, and it's wide array of mod slots allows it to be as powerful of a PvE ship as the Bulwark. It has 2 M-turrets, 4 S-turrets, and 3 PDTs.\nWeapons\nThere are three main classes of weapon: \nLaser weapons have no trade-off for hull or shield damage.\nKinetic weapons do more damage to the hull of an enemy ship, at the expense of the damage to shield.\nIon weapons do more damage to shields of an enemy ship, at the expense of the damage to the hull.\nAs a general rule, your ship should have a loadout of all the same weapons. If you mix your loadout, you will be less effective with any of them.\nSpinal Hardpoints\nFighters and interceptors have built-in, forward-facing guns that can be swapped between several different types for credits.\nBurst is the default laser weapon, and encouraged for most combat.\nPulse is a slow-firing, long-range beam of energy similar to Beam turrets. It is a laser weapon, and encouraged to only be used when long range is necessary.\nChaingun is a fast-firing kinetic weapon, and is generally inferior to Burst.\nPDTs\nPDTs, aka Point Defense turrets, are automatic, 180° turrets that are bought and installed directly from the ship edit menu. They can be used by all industrial ships, corvettes, frigates, and destroyers.\nRepeaters are laser weapons similar to the Burst spinal hardpoint, and are the default PDT installed on a newly assembled ship.\nPulse is a laser weapon similar to the Pulse spinal hardpoint, and are encouraged to only be used when long range is necessary.\nChaingun is a kinetic weapon similar to the Chaingun spinal hardpoint, and is generally inferior to Repeater.\nTractor is a non-combat PDT, included here for completion. They are used to tractor in ores while mining.\nS-turrets\nS-turrets, aka Small turrets, are manually-aimed, 180° turrets that are crafted, purchased, and stored as items. There is a wide variety of types, and they can be used on corvettes, frigates, and destroyers.\nFlak is a fast-firing laser weapon (despite having a physical projectile), that explodes with AoE damage when it gets within a certain proximity of a target. Although it was meant as an antifighter weapon, it does very little damage and is overall less effective at fighter control than the aimbot PDTs. It's exotic variant is the Dread Flak.\nShrapnel is a shotgun-esque kinetic weapon, best used in close-range brawling, preferably against a large, hard-to-miss target. It's exotic variant is the Dread Shrapnel.\nBlaster is a fast-firing, medium-damage, mid-range laser weapon. It's exotic variant is the Hybrid Blaster. It is mediocre at both PvP and PvE.\nCannon is a slow-firing, high-damage, mid-range laser weapon. It's exotic variant is the Hybrid Cannon. It is powerful in anti-warship PvP, and in destroying structures in PvE and FW.\nBeam is slow-firing, high-damage, and high-range laser weapon. It's exotic variant is the Hybrid Beam. Although it instantaneously reaches it's target, it has damage dropoff over long distances, making it less effective of a sniper as Railguns.\nCoilgun is a fast-firing, medium-damage, mid-range kinetic weapon. It's exotic variants are the Dread Coilgun and the Ancient Coilgun, which are equal in power. Because Drones and NPC Pirates are hull-based, Coilguns are the ideal PvE weapon.\nRailgun is a slow-firing, high-damage, and high-range kinetic weapon. It's exotic variants are the Dread Railgun and the Ancient Railgun, which are equal in power. It is a powerful long-range sniper weapon, provided that the user can lead their shots to account for the travel time.\nIon is a fast-firing, medium-damage, mid-range ion weapon. It's exotic variant is the Hybrid Ion. It has identical base stats to a Coilgun, but is only really useful in specific PvP situations against shield tanks such as Justice.\nM-turrets\nM-turrets, aka Medium turrets, are manually-aimed, 180° turrets that are crafted, purchased, and stored as items. There is a wide variety of types, and they are differentiated from their small variants by a -M suffix. Medium turrets can only be used on most destroyers.\nBlaster-M is a fast-firing, medium-damage, mid-range laser weapon. It's exotic variant is the Hybrid Blaster-M. It is mediocre at both PvP and PvE.\nCannon-M is a slow-firing, high-damage, mid-range laser weapon. It's exotic variant is the Hybrid Cannon-M. It is powerful in anti-warship PvP, and in destroying structures in PvE and FW.\nBeam-M is slow-firing, high-damage, and high-range laser weapon. It's exotic variant is the Hybrid Beam-M. Although it instantaneously reaches it's target, it has damage dropoff over long distances, making it less effective of a sniper as Railguns.\nCoilgun-M is a fast-firing, medium-damage, mid-range kinetic weapon. It's exotic variants are the Dread Coilgun-M and the Ancient Coilgun-M, which are equal in power. Because Drones and NPC Pirates are hull-based, Coilguns are the ideal PvE weapon.\nRailgun-M is a slow-firing, high-damage, and high-range kinetic weapon. It's exotic variants are the Dread Railgun-M and the Ancient Railgun-M, which are equal in power. It is a powerful long-range sniper weapon, provided that the user can lead their shots to account for the travel time.\nIon-M is a fast-firing, medium-damage, mid-range ion weapon. It's exotic variant is the Hybrid Ion-M. It has identical base stats to a Coilgun-M, but is only really useful in specific PvP situations against shield tanks such as Justice.\nStrategies\nKiting (going in an out of range of enemy ships while sniping them with beam of railgun turrets).\nBrawling (going close to enemies and holding down left click until either you or they die).\nFleet Skirmishes\nIn general, there are two concepts to internalize in multiplayer combat:\nFocus is the gauge at how well your fleet can focus on specific targets. This is determined through your fleet's cohesion (how well they listen to orders), and also on their positioning. Winning fleet engagements is all about focus fire on high priority targets, and continuous focusing until through a numbers advantage you can overwhelm the enemy.\nSpread is the gauge of how your ships are distributed across sectors and planets. Higher spread fleets tend to be less able to counter focusing enemies, while lower spread fleets tend to be able to focus on specific targets much easier but may lead to friendly fire or confusion. Having a high spread can means you cannot engage with your entire force's firepower, reducing your combat ability.\nWhile it is important to understand 1v1 mechanics in fleet combat, these two outweigh most other considerations. Fighters for instance have the ability to change their spread rapidly, meaning they can easily group up and focus on one enemy using their numbers. Fighter Death Blobs, up until the release of Flak Cannons, were the most effective piracy measure in the book for taking out frigates and keeping them warp disrupted.\nThis of course requires Scouting, which you should always do. Do not ever jump into a sector with a suspected fight, without first figuring out what is in that sector. Send in someone with a Stratos to figure out what is going on.\nAnother important idea is warp disruption. If the enemy don't like their odds, they can just run away. In wild sectors, you have Warp Disruptor bubbles, which can easily prevent the enemy from running. However, in engagements in unsecured sectors (such as around Gatinsir), it is critical to have a few ships which can prevent the enemy from escaping. \nNOTE: In Contested+ systems (Contested, Unsecure, and Wild) your ship WILL remain in space for 30 seconds if you leave the game without safe-logging. During this period your ship is vulnerable to player damage. However, NPC's will not attack your ship. It is highly recommended to safe-log. \nHaving this be a Fighter gives the advantage that it is very difficult to get out of the Warp Disruption without killing the Fighter. However, it being a Fighter, it can be flimsy, and Flak Cannons can mean that the trapped party can escape.\nHaving this be a Corvette is a decent choice, since a Corvette can chase down ships and has the health to not be terminated, and it can support Warmods.\nFrigates are a decent choice too, but they suffer from being too slow.\nExample - A good simulation is between 3 Frigates on Red, and 2 Frigates on Blue. This is an unsecured system, and Red has a Frigate in 3 of the 4 planets. Blue warps in, and Red doesn't know where they are coming in from. Blue's 2 frigates are fairly close together, and well-coordinated, able to disrupt and cripple the Red frigate before the other 2 Red frigates can warp in. The Blue frigates have taken minimal damage at this point, and can assume Red is coming, and as such they start flying away from the Warp zone (which they probably were already since they were chasing the crippled Red frigate). Now, Blue can either warp out after killing the Red frigate, or they can continue. If Red was not in a Voice Call, it could be possible for Blue to turn around, focus one of the frigates, and then move on to the other before the other Red frigate can support. If they did this, the 2nd Red Frigate will get downed, and the 3rd will have to flee or see a similar fate.\nStations - Multiplayer Combat is also categorized by the use of stations in combat. One of the best ways to get out of a losing situation is to run into a station, where you will find yourself unable to take damage. This does not mean you are immune, but it does mean the enemy have to get out of their ship to deal damage. \nWhen you are out of your ship, you will not lose it. Even if it is spawned, as long as you jump out of it and stay out of it, all you will lose upon death is what is in your inventory, and ~250 credits.\nPlayer Weapons (such as Pistols and Blasters) can damage ships. If you are being attacked by several players, a common tactic is to have someone block the docking process with a fighter, while another player pulls out their blaster and begins chipping away at the health of your ship. This will take some time, but if you remain inactive in this situation, you will eventually get your ship destroyed. Instead, try with everything you can to dock. If you are unable to, attempt what is called an Emergency Teleport.\nBy ramming your ship into a wall and wedging yourself, you can trigger a message from the game asking if they should unstick you. By accepting this in a station, there is a high chance that your ship is teleported out of the station, resulting in a few seconds where you may be able to warp out, without being warp disrupted or shot at. This is called an Emergency Teleport and should be a last-ditch effort if you are in an overwhelming situation.\nIf in doubt, warp log.\nRemember, if you lose a ship in Wild space, you lose it forever, along with your inventory.\nWith all this in mind, make sure to play close to stations in disadvantageous fights. Make sure you have armor and a blaster equipped too; you'll never know when you'll need it.\nKiting\nKiting is a strategy where you fly away from the enemy ship while still doing damage and is done well with kavani ships. or other speedy warships.\nKiting is usually done with a fast corvette, frigate or destroyer.\nRecommended kiting turrets would be beams, railguns and blaster.\nShips recommended are, Edict, Conciliator And Horizon.",

Fighter Death Blobs, up until the release of Flak Cannons, were the most effective piracy measure in the book for taking out frigates and keeping them warp disrupted.\nThis of course requires Scouting, which you should always do. Do not ever jump into a sector with a suspected fight, without first figuring out what is in that sector. Send in someone with a Stratos to figure out what is going on.\nAnother important idea is warp disruption. If the enemy don't like their odds, they can just run away. In wild sectors, you have Warp Disruptor bubbles, which can easily prevent the enemy from running. However, in engagements in unsecured sectors (such as around Gatinsir), it is critical to have a few ships which can prevent the enemy from escaping. \nNOTE: In Contested+ systems (Contested, Unsecure, and Wild) your ship WILL remain in space for 30 seconds if you leave the game without safe-logging. During this period your ship is vulnerable to player damage. However, NPC's will not attack your ship. It is highly recommended to safe-log. \nHaving this be a Fighter gives the advantage that it is very difficult to get out of the Warp Disruption without killing the Fighter. However, it being a Fighter, it can be flimsy, and Flak Cannons can mean that the trapped party can escape.\nHaving this be a Corvette is a decent choice, since a Corvette can chase down ships and has the health to not be terminated, and it can support Warmods.\nFrigates are a decent choice too, but they suffer from being too slow.\nExample - A good simulation is between 3 Frigates on Red, and 2 Frigates on Blue. This is an unsecured system, and Red has a Frigate in 3 of the 4 planets. Blue warps in, and Red doesn't know where they are coming in from. Blue's 2 frigates are fairly close together, and well-coordinated, able to disrupt and cripple the Red frigate before the other 2 Red frigates can warp in. The Blue frigates have taken minimal damage at this point, and can assume Red is coming, and as such they start flying away from the Warp zone (which they probably were already since they were chasing the crippled Red frigate). Now, Blue can either warp out after killing the Red frigate, or they can continue. If Red was not in a Voice Call, it could be possible for Blue to turn around, focus one of the frigates, and then move on to the other before the other Red frigate can support. If they did this, the 2nd Red Frigate will get downed, and the 3rd will have to flee or see a similar fate.\nStations - Multiplayer Combat is also categorized by the use of stations in combat. One of the best ways to get out of a losing situation is to run into a station, where you will find yourself unable to take damage. This does not mean you are immune, but it does mean the enemy have to get out of their ship to deal damage. \nWhen you are out of your ship, you will not lose it. Even if it is spawned, as long as you jump out of it and stay out of it, all you will lose upon death is what is in your inventory, and ~250 credits.\nPlayer Weapons (such as Pistols and Blasters) can damage ships. If you are being attacked by several players, a common tactic is to have someone block the docking process with a fighter, while another player pulls out their blaster and begins chipping away at the health of your ship. This will take some time, but if you remain inactive in this situation, you will eventually get your ship destroyed. Instead, try with everything you can to dock. If you are unable to, attempt what is called an Emergency Teleport.\nBy ramming your ship into a wall and wedging yourself, you can trigger a message from the game asking if they should unstick you. By accepting this in a station, there is a high chance that your ship is teleported out of the station, resulting in a few seconds where you may be able to warp out, without being warp disrupted or shot at. This is called an Emergency Teleport and should be a last-ditch effort if you are in an overwhelming situation.\nIf in doubt, warp log.\nRemember, if you lose a ship in Wild space, you lose it forever, along with your inventory.\nWith all this in mind, make sure to play close to stations in disadvantageous fights. Make sure you have armor and a blaster equipped too; you'll never know when you'll need it."
