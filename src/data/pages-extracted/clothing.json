Clothing is unique in that it is not lost upon death, although it will need to be re-equipped. Each NPC faction offers a uniform as a standing reward, but the military factions require you to enlist in their military to purchase their clothing.\nGeneral Clothing\nThis is easily available plain clothing you can pick up at any NPC marketplace.
