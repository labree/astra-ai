  "full_text": "Gate Systems\nIntact Stargate in G-05.\nOverview\nAll nine uncharted gate systems are located at the outer edge of wild space. At the center of each G-0X system is a pulsar, whose light rapidly pulsates and casts a flickering effect over objects in the system. All uncharted wild systems have only one accessible planet, and all other planets are inaccessible. Additionally, all planetary bodies in the systems are named 'Unknown.' The ancient warp relays are usually located inside of hardly visible black nebulae. \nThe system map for G-09. The star is selected, and its spectral class is N, indicating it is a neutron star.\nAncient Warp Relays, colloquially referred to as 'Gates' or 'Stargates', are structures located within uncharted gate systems. These structures are massive, shrouded in thick black nebulae, and are present within every G-0X uncharted system. The gates are located at each corner of the star cluster, and somewhat resemble the Warp Relay. Due to this, some players refer to it as a warp relay or warp-gate earning it it's nickname.\nName\nConnected Wild System\nDiscovered By\nG-01\nHualt\nBinaryTimeLord\nG-02\nVesma\nCarsondor\nG-03\nArpirom\nKarmaa7\nG-04\nToracas\nExobase\nG-05\nLisaer\nDrezzlez\nG-06\nArosiah\npiquin07\nG-07\nIo Zadkia\nDedweight\nG-08\nDroku\ncybrecker912\nG-09\nDelta Anca\nDavidshark415\nG-01 to G-08\nContain black nebulae and inactive stargates.\nG-09\nG-09 was the first uncharted system to be discovered. The relay itself has been torn in half, multiple enigmatic shipwrecks surrounding it. These consist of three capital ships and dozens of starfighters. Their color scheme is fossil gray, smoky gray, and bronze. The three capital ships are the only ships in the game bearing custom nameplates, dubbed the Blade of Perseus, Singularity, and Blue Space. All of these capital ships have modeled bridges, though armored humanoid corpses are visible only inside the Blade of Perseus'. The planet has a molten and shattered crust, along with a debris ring.
