  "full_text": "Ancient Drones, also called as X-Structure Drones are an unique variant of drones found in X-Structure aberrations.\n\nThese drones are rumoured to be a predecessor or an ancestor to current-day drones. They appear in most X-Structures. They can be found in intact structures which are found only by an ancient beacon.\nIn regular x-structures, they exist as only shipwrecks. However, when exiting warp into an intact structure, a squadron of ancient drones can be found roaming idly around. These are indicated as simply “Ancient Drones”. These drones will attempt to attack you upon being noticed.\n\nThey do not have shielding, and energy weaponry, and their glowing stripes and engine trails are a yellowish-orange. \nThey only have weak hull and armor plating. Their armament consists of Coilguns for the corvette vessels and an unknown kinetic spinal gun for fighters, which appears to use the same type of rounds as that of the coilgun turret. \nAncient drones drop Metal Scrap, Ancient Drone Cores, and occasionaly common materials.\nAncient drones were added in the Echoes of the Past update on the 3rd of June, 2021.\n\nAncient drones have less health then any ship in the game.\nThey can be tanked with any corvette.",
