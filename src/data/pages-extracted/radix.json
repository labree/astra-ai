  "full_text": "Radix\n\"The Radix corvette has a radical design, giving it a significant speed advantage over ships of a comparable size. It is significantly less armored, in the hopes that its speed and maneuverability allow it to avoid damage altogether.\"\nThe Radix is a corvette-class ship of the Constellation Ship Line. It is best suited for fast exploration or kiting, though not as good as the Valiance line at the latter activity.\nAdvantages\nThe Radix has fast sublight and warp speed, making it good for exploration, with suitable defenses as a corvette while keeping a sizable speed advantage. Augmented by its engine rig slots, this ship can rival the speed of a fightercraft. This corvette is also the fastest corvette in the game according to raw speed.\nDisadvantages\nThe Radix is fragile, even more so than the Infinity. When caught at close range, it can be gunned down quite quickly. This makes it risky to use for combat.\nTrivia\n- The current Radix is modeled by Infranium157.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nConstellation Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nStratos\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nT2\nExotic",
