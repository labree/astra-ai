  "full_text": "Justice\n\"The Justice is a well-rounded and powerful warship, and the prized destroyer of the Lycentian Starfleet.”\nThe Justice is a destroyer-class ship of the Righteous ship line. It is best suited as a sturdy support destroyer in a fleet. It is suited to brawling, shield tanking, station camping for PVP, and it also excels at PVE, along with the Bulwark and Conciliator. Overall, the Justice is a fleet-centered and defensive-focused ship, and requires a skilled and cautious player to win in solo PvP.\nAdvantages\nThe Justice is a Lycentian ship and thus has excellent shielding, with can be further enhanced with defense rigs. It can track ships much better than other destroyers due to its turret agility bonus. Its high shielding means it can dock after taking significant damage, making it very useful in PvP. Also, the Justice takes less damage from players who use coilgun/chaingun turrets, as they deal less damage to shields.\nIts turret placement is considered good, as it can fire all turrets in a broadside. This makes it a popular choice for PvE along with the Bulwark, Echelon, and Conciliator.\nDisadvantages\nThe Justice's low hull and mobility make it poor at retreating when shields are low. It also has extremely poor shield regeneration for the amount of shield it has. Its below-average mobility means it can be kited by faster ships such the Conciliator and Fortitude (this can be countered using a lightburner). Furthermore, players using blaster turrets can quickly deplete its shields by abusing the Justice's poor shield regen. Players must also be careful to conserve energy, as Large Shield Repairers deplete energy at an alarming rate.\nAs a Lycentian ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a Lycentian terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\nThe current Justice is modeled by AVeryDandyLad.\nThe justice's inter-system warp sound is actually out of sync for when it actually warps by about half a second.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nRighteous Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nTetra\nLuster\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nDignity\nNobility\nT2\nTriazo\nLucent\nExotic",
