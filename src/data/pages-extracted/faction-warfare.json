  "full_text": "Faction Warfare\nFaction Warfare is the general term used to describe the war within contested systems, and the system that players can use to interact with it. The factions involved are the Lycentian Federation, the Foralkan Empire, and the Kavani Mandate.\nLocation\nFaction warfare takes place primarily in Contested Systems, with Staging Areas playing a significant role. Contested Systems are a blend between Secure and Unsecure systems; like Unsecure, PvP is enabled, although not between players aligned with the same faction. However, unlike Unsecure, disruptors are disabled, making it far safer, as trying to warp out is viable. Players can also take shelter behind the shield that (typically) protects the faction HQ, if they're affiliated with said faction. This makes them protected and completely unkillable under normal circumstances. Contested Systems come in four variations, or tiers: New Claims, which are newly captured systems; Outposts, with have had 100 crates hauled to the faction HQ; Garrisons, with an additional 300 crates, and finally, Strongholds, requiring an additional 1000.\nStaging Areas are core systems. Each major faction owns two, one per front. Staging areas have supply docks where it is possible to pick up supplies to haul to Contested Systems, so as to improve their defenses.\nSystem capture\n\nCapture Status\nSystems can only be captured if they are directly on the front lines - connected by just one warp jump to territory of the opposing faction - and six hours have elapsed since they last changed hands. As such, once a system is taken, it is invulnerable for six hours. 40 minutes of invulnerability are added when a neighboring system of an opposing faction is captured but the system itself is still connected to enemy-controlled systems.\nHow to Capture\nFirst, the three shield generators must be disabled. These can be scattered across the system or concentrated at a single planet (or anything in between), and their location is given by the Faction Warfare GUI in the top left corner. These are represented by 3 lightning bolts. They have a few turrets, but are generally not a major challenge. However, they may include defense platforms (up to six for each generator, more information given below). The generators, after being disabled, are automatically repaired after half an hour. The timer starts as soon as the generator is disabled, which means you usually have less than 30 minutes to capture a system (the shield surrounding the HQ goes back up as soon as one of the shield generators comes back online). After all three generators are disabled, the shield goes down and allows you to attack the sovereignty beacon. Destroying the beacon also destroys the HQ, and captures the system for the attacking faction. \nObstacles\nYou will encounter various obstacles on the way to victory. One, obviously, are enemy players. A skilled enemy player can be incredibly dangerous, especially if they are defending and, as a result, have the upper hand. Assuming no enemy players are present you will encounter many NPC fleets, some of which can dish out serious damage if given the chance. One major fleet is stationed at the HQ, and the power of the fleet will scale with the level of the system (i.e. Stronghold systems usually have cruisers and destroyers, while New Claims may have more frigates and corvettes). These will always spawn with the There could also be another large fleet that warps around the system, which may contain several ace cruisers and should generally be avoided. In addition, especially in more well-defended systems, other obstacles may exist, such as Defense Platforms (static platform with turrets) that protect the generators, Fleet Hangars (which will continually spawn numerous defending fighters and sometimes corvettes), and Faction Battleships (constructed by faction shipyards). NPC ships come in differing levels of power, listed below.\nNormal (for example, Kavani Frigate) - base models\nVeteran (for example, Veteran Foralkan Interceptor) - slightly buffed\nAce (for example, Ace Lycentian Cruiser) - significantly buffed\nHomeland - massively buffed, taking different names depending on faction (Federal Lycentian ships, Sovereign Kavani ships, and Imperial Foralkan ships) \nReinforcement Beacons\nReinforcement beacons are large circles in the color of their respective faction. They can be captured by attacking forces (staying in the circle until the bar reaches 100%) to call in allied NPC ships which will aid in the assault. However, they take a significant amount of time to capture, so it's best done before generators are disabled if the attackers want to fully utilize the reinforcements. They're often overlooked when operating with a large fleet, however, solo-cappers or small fleets will usually make more effective use of them. Note that while they will help with the generators, they will not move on the HQ until 15 minutes have elapsed.\nSolo-Capturing\nSolo-capturing entails doing all the work to capture a system. This yields massive LP rewards, but is difficult and dangerous. First, capture all the reinforcement beacons. This will make the operation far simpler, as the enemy defenses will typically prioritize the NPCs as long as you keep your distance. Then, take out the generators. The amount of damage required to disable a generator scales with difficulty, so New Claims are recommended for solo capping. Finally, move on to the HQ. Carefully take down the NPC fleet, keeping a few fighters alive to prevent larger warships from continuously respawning, while also making sure to not get too close. In addition, higher tier stations will feature not just the station turrets, but up 6 defense modules, 3 on each side, which contain 2 L and 8 M turrets each. Next, begin peak gameplay - blasting away mindlessly at the HQ's sovereignty beacon (these can have several hundred thousand hitpoints, depending on the system tier). Be wary of enemy players, as skilled players can easily wipe out even the strongest of fleets. It's advisable to only conduct solo operations in a destroyer, due to the immense amount of firepower needed to capture systems.\nReinforcing\nReinforcing Contested Systems means using a hauler to bring supplies to the System Headquarters and other structures. These supplies are picked up from the respective faction's staging area. They can be used to upgrade the tier of the system, as well as create defensive buildings like Fleet Hangars and Defense Platforms. They can also create economic buildings like Mining Platforms. Finally, they can be used to construct massive Battleships, through the use of a shipyard. Note two things - first, be mindful of other players, as contested systems are dangerous places to haul. Even though warp disruption is disabled, players can still employ high DPS loadouts to destroy the much weaker haulers before they can warp out. While pirating is typically not conducted in Contested systems due to the relatively high difficulty of success (in comparison to other system classes such as Unsecure or Wild), some players may consider this as a viable option. Secondarily, note that only delivering to the HQ yields credits and LP, while all other constructions simply support the faction's control over the system. Many buildings can only be built after the HQ is upgraded, and fully upgrading an HQ to Stronghold will stop LP and credit rewards for faction supplies to the HQ.\nTrivia\nGenerally, mining in Mining Platform areas is less profitable than mining in Wild space.\nYour biggest concern is typically NPC fleets that may warp in and force you to flee the area. Other concerns could be other players entering the system, which could cause you to either leave the system or leave the game entirely, further driving down profit margins.\nHowever, one large benefit to mining in Contested is the general lack of lower quality ores (assuming a mining platform is built). Furthermore, most aberrations in Contested systems will often yield Superior or even Pristine ore, and although the ore is typically lower tier (Korrelite, Reknite, Gellium, and sometimes Axnit) they come in greater amounts than in Wild space and are much easier to find.\nAs an added bonus, ring asteroids tend to be massive, regardless of whether a mining platform is built, allowing you to acquire vast amounts of lower quality material at a much faster rate (if the particular system contains a ring planet).\nContested systems also feature guaranteed in-system station services (if one is apart of the respective faction's military), allowing players to operate directly out of a Contested system. This is in stark contrast to Wild space, where players must journey to and from the Core in order to drop off materials, and carries a greater risk as pirates frequently camp Wild-Unsecure warp points, waiting for unsuspecting players.\nNPC ships of the opposite faction (i.e. Kavani ships in Lycentian space, or Foralkan ships in Kavani space) will give credits if killed by a player affiliated with the respective system's faction military in Contested systems. The credit amount will scale with the tier of ship and the class of ship (i.e. a federal Lycentian cruiser will give more credits compared to a veteran Kavani frigate).",
