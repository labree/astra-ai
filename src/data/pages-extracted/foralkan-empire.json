  "full_text": "Foralkan Empire\nThe Foralkan Empire or Foralkan Star Empire is one of Starscape's three primary factions. It's primarily composed of contested systems, as with the other two primary factions, but still maintains about a third of its territories as secure - again, in accordance with the other two. It is located on the bottom right-hand side/south-east side of the map, bordering the Kavani Mandate, the Lycentian Federation and sometimes the Trade Union depending on the state of the Kavani-Foralkan front. The current emperor is Hippaforalkus III. Many people shorten the name to \"Fork\" when talking about equipment and ships to denote that said equipment or ship is Foralkan, although some people will call them \"Fish\" instead of \"Fork\" due to their ship names.\nHistory\nA century ago, the Foralkan Empire did not exist. The ambition and drive of a single fleet admiral changed all of that, transforming the single-system vassal of the Lycentians into a powerful military force. After a peace accord with the Lycentians recognizing its existence, the Empire became integrated with the galactic economy and solidified its place in the galaxy not simply as a military threat, but as a complex and enduring nation to be reckoned with. Though its expansion has slowed in recent years, the Foralkans have continued to test the borders of both the Lycentians and the Kavani through repeated incursions into their claimed territory.\n-The known lore of the Empire, Starscape\nThe Foralkan Empire is the youngest of the 3 main powers in Starscape, not even being 100 years old.\nMilitary\nTo keep order in the large empire, the Foralkans have their own specialized combat warships and fighters. Their warship lines have a built-in damage buff which increases damage inflicted on enemies. Their main naval force is the Foralkan Imperial Armada. They use the Megalodon warship line, which includes the Sunfish as their main cruiser, and occasionally the Ptychodus battleship. The Thresher is the fighter class ship used by the Foralkans. It is compared to the Sabre line due to the tankiness and damage. \nEnlisting\nPlayers can enlist in the Foralkan army by talking to an NPC in field offices who are located next to the terminal. Players can also enlist in contested systems by talking to an NPC that is located next to the terminal in the middle of the station, or by talking to an ambassador at the Citadel. By enlisting, players will not be able to damage Foralkus NPC ships as well as other enlisted players in contested systems. Players can not resign from the army unless they have served for at least 24 hours.\nRanking Up\nTo rank up in the military, you must first be enlisted in the desired faction's military. When doing missions, as well as earning faction standing you also earn Loyalty Points, which can be used to buy faction items as well as rank up in the faction's military program.\nMilitary Ranks\nSee Enlisting\nStanding\nStanding is used to acquire Foralkan Empire rewards and titles. Standing is acquired from missions and standing items and can be checked by opening your inventory and going to the standing tab on the top bar. Missions are granted by agents in field offices — the agent you need of your respective tier can be found using the Agent Finder on the map, on the top left. Higher tier agents require more standing to unlock, but have a chance of giving missions that will give more standing. To access current active missions, players can go to the Missions tab on the top bar in their inventory.\nReputation items are items that can be turned in at Field Office terminals. The Foralkan Empire accepts reputation items from the Kavani Mandate and the Lycentian Federation. Reputation items can be found by killing NPCs of their respective faction, or by purchasing them from players.\nStanding Items\nStanding Items are the necessary bits of loot required to increase standing with each faction. Standing items can be turned in using a Foralkan terminal located in Foralkan field offices or talking to the Foralkan ambassador located at the Citadel. \nItem\nEffect\nKavani/Lycentian Insignia\n+7\nKavani/Lycentian Pilot Helmet\n+15\nKavani/Lycentian Mission Log\n+30\nAgent System Locations\nTier 0\nTier 1\nTier 2\nTier 3\nTier 4\nTier 5\nAepaltor\nAlpha Droac\nBeta Altclee\nBeta Altclee\nBeta Spias\nEojmoil\nAlpha Droac\nEaltfiod\nClilo\nCliuz\nEojmoil\nFlaisoal\nDelta Hilir\nEbrefin\nDelta Hilir\nEbrefin\nFlaisoal\nInolceoct\nEdithye\nEox-toek\nDelta Nirig\nMiadoa\nInolceoct\nIrhirese\nEegydkae\nGamma Ydgroo\nEdithye\nOgearg\nOmogast\nOmogast\nHippa\nHippa\nGamma Ydgroo\nUastcasi\nOoctu\nOoctu\nMiadoa\nKlaex-pleehoa\nHippa\nUstsirhir\nPojit\nPojit\nOgearg\nUstsirhir\nPix-nium\nZeayae\nRetoang-25\nRetoang-25\nSirjit\nZeayae\nTaydax\nSiometox\nSiometox\nUangedi\nZoasan\nTau Tertor\nTau Tertor\nUastkasi\nToryd\nZiedi\nZiedi\nRewards\nThe Foralkan Empire grants rewards at various standing and military levels, which can be used in different ways depending on what they are.\nStanding Rewards\nItem Type\nItem\nTier\nDescription\nTitle\nI\nUnlocks equippable \"Foralkan Associate\" title.\nFurniture\nI\nCan now purchase a Foralkan Empire Banner at a Foralkan terminal for 50 loyalty points.\nFurniture\nI\nCan now purchase a Foralkan Empire Holoprojector at a Foralkan terminal for 25 loyalty points.\nUpgrade\nII\nCan now purchase a Foralkan Targeter II at a Foralkan terminal for 50 loyalty points.\nPerk\nIII\nDiscounts Foralkan warp relay jumps by 25%.

Additionally, players with -500 standing (Suspect) will not be allowed to enter Foralkan military stations.\nIn contested space, hangars part of the Empire will produce fighters to assist in the defense of the system. The AI is spread around to different structures, most commonly the Generator, and flies around it until a known threat is in the planet or system. When a pirate or enemy faction fleet, or a player of an opposing faction warps in, all ships built by the hangar and randomly generated fleets will warp towards the threat, attempting to eliminate or deter them.\nThe Foralkan Empire fires on any drones or NPC pirates that are in their targeting range, as well as ships from the Kavani Mandate and Lycentian Federation.\nForalkan ships, like other NPC militaries, are primarily armed with Cannons, Beams, and Repeaters, in various configurations.\nTrivia\nThe name of the faction, as well as the home planet, was inspired by Hippaforalkus, a former Roblox user who ZolarKeth credits on his profile as someone who kickstarted his Roblox career.\nThis is the only warring faction with more secure systems than unsecure systems, and also the only one to not have permanent systems in the triple digits.\nNotes\n↑ 1.0 1.1 All systems in this list are Unsecure. Beware of NPCs and Pirates and it's recommended to store valuables beforehand.",
