  "full_text": "Player Factions\nPlayer factions are unofficial factions that players can create and join. The political and management state of each faction is dependent on its owner. Factions can be used in a variety of ways (like as groups for mining, drone hunting, etc), but most are made to create organized groups within the game.\nWIKI RULES ON PLAYER FACTIONS\nPlayer faction pages are not to be created to prevent drama and flame wars. Any created player faction pages that are found will be marked for deletion, then terminated.\nMaking a Faction\nA player can view the faction they are currently in by opening their inventory and clicking on the star icon on the left of the GUI. If the player is not already a member of a player faction, then they can choose to create one for 25,000 credits.\nFaction management\n\nFaction Upgrades\nFactions have 4 levels, each level unlocking unique perks and features. Each successful upgrade will cost an amount of credits; which are credits that come from a faction's treasury. In total, a fully upgraded faction will cost 1,375,000 credits, but it is advised to only upgrade to level 4 when you have reached your member limit. Level 3 is something all factions should be levelled at.\nFaction levels\nFaction Level\nCost to buy from previous level\nUnlocked rewards\nI (Company)\n25,000 CR\n50 member limit\nII (Corporation)\n100,000 CR\n100 member limit, Customizable faction tag\nIII (Enterprise)\n250,000 CR\n200 member limit, Customizable faction skin, Customizable faction insignia\nIV (Nation)\n1,000,000 CR\n500 member limit\nFaction Treasury\nThe faction treasury is a feature used for storing funds in a faction. These funds can be used to upgrade factions, or for other miscellaneous purposes. Leaders and treasurers have the authority to withdraw credits from their treasury's funds, while members without this authority may donate credits for their treasury to fund their faction.\nFaction Menu\n\nOverview\nThis tab allows players to view announcements, which are rarely used unless the faction has no discord; the description of the faction, the faction statistics, and allows them to leave or donate to the faction.\nMembers\nThis tab allows players with recruiter permissions to recruit people remotely (as long as they are online and you know their username)It also lists members, their period in the faction, and their roles.\nLeader - all access\nAnnouncer - ability to create announcements\nAmbassador - ability to change faction relations\nTreasurer - ability to take from the treasury \nAuditor - ability to see the audit log\nRemover - ability to remove members\nRecruiter - ability to add members\nRelations\nThis tab allows players to see a faction's relations to other factions.

A player faction can have relations with 250 other factions, at most. Faction relations are as follows:\nAlly - Blue\nFriendly - Light Blue\nNeutral - Yellow\nSuspect - Orange\nEnemy - Red\nUnlisted - No Color (Grey in player list)\nSpecial Note, that just because a faction is set a certain color, does NOT mean that they also have you set as that color.

If you can't see your faction symbol, please wait a few minutes for Roblox to verify your decal, or reupload it with one pixel’s color changed.\nThis is unlocked when you upgrade your faction to Tier III. It’s free to initially set one, but costs 25K to change.",
