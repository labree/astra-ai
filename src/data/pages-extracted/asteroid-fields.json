  "full_text": "Asteroid Fields\nAsteroid Fields are a common feature in Starscape and can be found in almost every System in the game, the few exceptions being certain Core systems like Harbor or Syndica. Asteroid fields can generate as planetary Warp Hub features, and will always generate in Rings, R-Deposit Aberrations, and in select Anomalies. \nPlanetary asteroid fields are the most common version of asteroid field, found throughout the galaxy. Though far larger in scale than the other variants, they almost always contain hostile Drones and only basic ores, making the other variants generally more attractive to mine at. The only benefits planetary warp hub asteroid fields have are the sheer quantity of basic materials. This type of asteroid field can contain resources like Korrelite and Reknite in Secure systems, all the way up to regular blue Narcor in Wilds. \nA Ring is an area accessible in all ringed planets, and always contain a vast area filled entirely to the brim with asteroids. While most are unminable and only there for cosmetics, the remaining asteroids are huge versions of the normal kind, often containing 150-250 ore. Compared to the usual amounts of 15-80 ore per asteroid, ring asteroid fields are far superior to open-space asteroid fields when it comes to bulk mining of common resources. The only enemies that can spawn in these areas come with when a Drone Presence, a Drone Factory, or a Pirate Den spawn. This variant of asteroid field can contain Korrelite and Reknite in Secure space, all the way up to Axnit or regular blue Narcor in deep Wild space. \nAberration asteroid fields can vary in usefulness. X-Structure aberrations often spawn with a barren asteroid field around the main structure, being completely useless for mining. On the other hand, R-Deposit aberrations are an extremely valuable mining area. These common aberrations spawn in most Ringed planets, often 2 or 3 at a time. Inside, there will be the barren ring asteroid field, with a small-medium patch of rocks of a certain type of ore. All mineable asteroids in an R-deposit will be the same type of ore, except in the rare case of a Narcor deposit, which contains both the regular blue and Red variants of Narcor. Another deposit with slightly different rules is the Vexnium deposit. These are more similar to VX anomalies than to other deposits, containing lightning, black nebulae, hibernating Crystallines, and a couple of Vexnium asteroids. \nLastly, asteroid fields can spawn in Anomalies. While every anomaly has a chance of a barren asteroid field spawning in it, representing the anomaly being in a stellar asteroid belt, there are several types of anomalies that contain mineable asteroid fields, including AT, AL, FO, CM, AA, AN, and VX anomalies. More detail on them is given below. \nAnomaly Variants\n\nAT Anomaly\n \nThe AT Anomaly is an anomaly that can be found in any system except Core and Uncharted systems. It usually contains around 10-20 asteroids, their rarity and purity depending on the system status. Secure systems usually have Superior Korrelite and Reknite, regular Gellium, Axnit, and rarely Narcor. ATs in Wild systems, on the other hand, have a higher chance of contain Pristine ores, as well as ore types up to Red Narcor.\nAL Anomaly\nThe AL Anomaly is very similar to the AT Anomaly, except it is much less common and significantly larger, with more asteroids, up to the size of some of the smaller planetary warp hub fields. The rarity of the ores remains the same as in ATs.\nMT Anomaly\nAn MT anomaly is an anomaly that contains a T3 Monument, and is free from drones or pirates. Along with the bonus of having a large ring of pristine-quality ores (These ores are inclusive of only Korrelite, Reknite, and Gellium), these monuments also give a powerful Tier 3 blessing. The MT anomaly is decently common, making it a viable option for mining.\nFO Anomaly\nThe FO Anomaly is a wild-space-only anomaly containing a Syndicate Frontier Outpost. While these anomalies are certainly not meant for mining, surrounding the outpost is always a medium-sized asteroid field of mineable, regular-quality Korrelite. Never bother mining here, as there are always better options.\nCM Anomaly\nThe CM anomaly is an uncommon anomaly that can be found in all security classes except for Core and Uncharted. It contains a large comet, with an asteroid field trailing behind in the tail. Approximately half of the rocks are unminable Barren Fragments, while the other half contain Water Ice Cores. At the present, this anomaly is the only way to get the Water Ice resource, aside from trading for it from another player who found a CM.\nAA Anomaly\n \nThe AA Anomaly is quite uncommon, and contains only Regular and Pristine Axnit. It can only be found in Contested, Unsecure and Wild systems, and is usually about the size of an AT anomaly field or smaller.\nAN Anomaly\nAN Anomalies are rare anomalies that can only be found in wild systems. They are small fields of Narcor and Red Narcor Ore. These fields of rare materials were previously the rarest Anomaly in the game, now tied only with the legendary VX anomaly. If you find one, mine all the Red Narcor first, as it is significantly more valuable.\n \nVX Anomaly\nVX Anomalies, also known as Vexnium Anomalies, are strange areas found at about the same frequency as AN anomalies. They consist of a medium-large field of unmineable pure black asteroids, some of which with blue spikes sticking out of them. Untouched VX Anomalies will contain a several small, yellow-spiked vexnium asteroids, as well as several hibernating Crystalline beings scattered throughout the asteroid field. Clouds of black gas surround the entire asteroid field, obscuring players' views of the place, along with lightning visual effects, similar to the environment at the Gate Systems. One can only mine vexnium with mining beams, whether from a mining turret or the beam hardpoint, and once they have at least mined one vexnium, the guardians will awaken and try to kill all players in the anomaly, using powerful lightning blasts that do roughly 200-300 damage per hit. To successfully defeat the crystalline guardians and mine the vexnium, a pilot either needs immense skill with a corvette, a good frigate, a powerful destroyer jury-rigged with a mining turret, or a tanky miner like the Yukon with certain modules and weapons.\n-Extra:\nDue to some bug in-game, cosmetic(unminable)asteroids or the planetary ring itself may be rendered when warping to another anomaly/abberation. VX Anomaly lightning can also be rendered in.\nFor example, one is a fully mined MT Anomaly with unminable asteroids in the background which is not present, and another is a X-Structure with extra asteroids, a planetary ring and VX lightning.\nThis makes up for some interesting and nice environments and scenery can be good screenshot\n \n ",
