It is always escorted by 6 other drone warships, which are composed of Elite Destroyers or Elite Frigates. It generally requires several people in order to destroy a Drone Battleship, but many skilled players regularly defeat them solo in Destroyers. Soloing one is usually a challenge, but is certainly doable and even easy for more experienced players.

They only exist within contested systems, and can only spawn when a capital shipyard has been built. They take 30 minutes to construct and are not to be taken lightly, as they can easily destroy even the strongest of fleets (both player and NPC). Because of their minimal/complete lack of loot combined with high defensive and offensive capability, they are usually better avoided rather than battled. \nA Foralkan battleship, Ptychodus.A Lycentian battleship, Nobility.A Kavani battleship, Conqueror.\nBattleships have a unique theme song when in combat.
