  "summary": "The Refinery is a station module that exists in many Industrial Stations and The Citadel. The Refinery, as its name suggests, is used for refining raw ores into processed materials, and for scrapping other items, like metal scraps, modules, and ships. Metal scraps can refine into any material except Vexnium, but can also yield nothing. Modules, ships, and other items that are scrapped will return a small percentage of their crafting cost. ",
