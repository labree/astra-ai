  "full_text": "Freighter\nFreighters are peaceful NPC vendor ships that can be owned by either the Trade Union or the Syndicate.\nTrade Union freighters can spawn in Secure, Contested, and Unsecure systems, whereas Syndicate Freighters only spawn in Contested, Unsecure, and Wild space. They can be seen warping in if a player is already observing the spot where the freighter spawned. Otherwise, a freighter will be visible to the player upon exiting warp. Syndicate Freighters generally sell better items than Trade Union Freighters, but Trade Union freighters are more common. Also, reaching Tier II and Tier IV standing for Trade Union and the Syndicate will allow you to get discount perks for their freighters, which will allow you to buy items for much lower than standard marketplace prices.\n \nA Freighter will shoot back in self-defense if shot at, and will attempt to warp out of the system when it begins taking hull damage. When killed, it has a very small chance to drop some of the items it was selling. If it is killed by a player, they will lose 10 standing with the faction the Freighter belonged to.\nFreighter ships cannot be obtained by the player yet but will be able to in an update soon..\nTrivia\nThe current freighters use models of Destroyer Haulers: the Andromeda, and the Mantle.\nThe Trade Union and Syndicate freighter models are used for the “Protect the Transport” and “Rescue Operation” missions for each of their respective factions. These transport variants have empty cargo slots.\nThe old Freighter models are named the Titan and Bison, from ZolarKeth's old game Keth's Shipyards.\nThe old model of the Syndicate Freighter\n↑ File:Freighter Names.png",
