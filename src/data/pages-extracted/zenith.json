It is best suited as an agile but deadly fighter-interceptor combination.\nAdvantages\nThe Zenith has much more speed compared to heavy fightercraft such as the Sabre or Aurora, and can fly circles around them with the proper loadout. In addition, it can take and give out a respectable amount of damage despite being an entry-level interceptor.\nDisadvantages\nThe Zenith is an entry-level ship, and thus will perform poorly against upgraded fightercraft. As an interceptor itself, warships with turret hardpoints or point defense will be able to gun it down quite easily as well.\nTrivia\n- The current Zenith is modeled by AVeryDandyLad.\nInterceptors\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nDefiance\nFalcon\nParagon\nHybrid Paragon\nValiance\nZenith\nPolaris\nHybrid Polaris\nMegalodon\nMackerel\nCandiru\nMandator\nParrot\nMacaw\nRighteous\nTetra\nTriazo\nValiance Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nZenith\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortiude\nT2\nPolaris\nExotic\nHybrid Polaris",
