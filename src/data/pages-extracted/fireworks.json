The only way of obtaining fireworks was from events, not they can only be bought on the player marketplace. They come in various types such as White, Pink, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, and Snowflake.\nUsage\nTo use the fireworks, they must be in your inventory. Push Ctrl or Z and select them from the launch menu. They can be launched from any ship, and upon being launched the firework will travel a short distance before exploding. Please note that they do not have any real function to utilize throughout the game other than just for show, and do no damage. Like all deployables, they will be used up once fired.\nPlayer market\n \nDue to the rarity of fireworks, they sell frequently in the player market for a lot of credits. The color of the Firework doesn't change the price, but Snowflake Fireworks are sold for much less than other Fireworks, because so many more were obtained during their event.\nSnowflake Fireworks\nSnowflake Fireworks were available during the Winter Update from Drone drops. They are no longer available, but there are large quantities still in circulation because players stocked up during the Winter Update event. Because of this, Snowflake fireworks are far less valuable than their colored counterparts, often being listed at around 10,000 to 25,000 credits.",
