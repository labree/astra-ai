  "full_text": "Item Classification\nItem classification is how Starscape describes how easy items are to obtain. For example, a simple mine or ore would be Common, while a blueprint guarded by enemies could be Legendary. The game uses two types of systems to classify items: Rarity and Tier.\nThis wiki will, for the sake of clarity, call these two systems Rarity and Tier. While this page will not list every item and its rarity, this page will serve as a reference guide for users to easily identify rarity and how it is referred to on the wiki.\n- The Rarity system colors the entire item icon's background, and is used to signify how rare an item is - with parameters ranging from cost to drop chance. For wiki icons, this is represented by the background color.\n- The Tier system adds a triangle with Roman numerals to the icon, used to signify how advanced an item is statistically. For wiki icons, this is represented by the overriden border color (if a tier exists).\nNote that by default, Rarity defines the border color of an item, unless otherwise overriden by a Tier designation, which chooses its own color. For example, a Common item that has a Tier I designation will use the preferred Uncommon border color. This applies both in-game and on the wiki.\nWhile this page will not list every item and its rarity, this page will serve as a reference guide for users to easily identify rarity and how it is referred to on the wiki.\nRarity\nToggle Rarities\nIcon\nName\nInformation\nInferior\nInferior designations are used for items that provide little value, such as metal scrap or damaged items.\nCommon\nCommon designations are used for items that are not difficult to obtain, such as low-tier ore and Basic tier items.\nUncommon\nUncommon designations are used for items that are somewhat difficult to obtain, such as low-tier salvage and Tier I modules.\nRare\nRare designations are used for items that are difficult to obtain, such as mid-tier salvage and Tier II modules.\nVery Rare\nRare designations are used for items that are very difficult to obtain, such as high-tier salvage and Tier III modules.\nLegendary\nLegendary designations are used for items that are extremely difficult to obtain, such as Vexnium ore or Drone Command Cores.\nAncient\nAncient designations are used for items that are only obtainable from Ancient structures and their respective loot.
