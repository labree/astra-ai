  "full_text": "Drones\nFor a guide to hunting drones, see Drone Hunting.\nA Drone Battleship spotted in wild space.\nDrones are hostile non-player characters (NPCs) that exist in Secure, Contested, Unsecure, and Wild systems. They deliberately attack any non-drone ship - including NPC pirates - that come within 3,200 meters, and return fire to any ship that damages them from within 5,000 meters. The farther a player is from the Citadel, usually the tougher and more abundant drones will become. Due to the varying strength of drone encounters, players should carefully consider their own capabilities and equipment before engaging drones in battle. \nDrones are an interstellar threat to the human factions, and are labelled as a “shoot-on-sight” target by both the warring NPC factions and the players. \nSpawn Locations\n\nPlanets\nDrones often spawn over planets with Asteroid Fields and Battlefields. They also spawn in Ring asteroid fields.\nAnomalies\nDrones can be found at three anomalies: DH, SP, and BF.\nDH anomalies are the only place where any variety of Drone Cruiser can be found.\nDrone Fleets\nDrone Fleet events can spawn in any Warp Hub or Ring in charted non-Core systems. See Drone Fleets for more information.\nDrone Factories\nDrone Factory events can spawn in any Warp Hub or Ring in charted non-Core systems. See Drone Factories for more information.\nX Structures\nAncient Drones are a unique type of drone is found at intact X-structures, which can only be discovered with the use of Ancient Beacons. \nAncient drones only possess hull health, with no shields, and are very weak. Ancient drones were added in the Echoes of the Past update on the 3rd of June, 2021.\nAncient Drones only spawn as Fighters or Corvettes.\nDrone Types\nThere are six classes of drones: Light, Standard, Advanced, Elite, Command, and Ancient. Light and Standard drones are black with red lights, Advanced drones are red with yellow lights, Elite drones are navy blue with violet lights, Command drones are white with blue lights, and Ancient drones are brown with orange lights. In addition, Ancient drones only come in fighter and corvette variants, and are slightly bigger and differently shaped than other drones.\nThere are seven hull classes of drones: Interceptor, Fighter, Corvette, Turret, Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, and Battleship. \nDrone Fighters/Interceptors are fast and agile, but have low shield, hull, and firepower. They come in all variants.\nDrone Turrets are stationary drones that have one beam turret on each side. They have no shields, only hull. They can be found at Drone Factories and Drone Hideouts, as well as in certain quest areas such as Rescue Mission. They come only in Regular to Elite variants.\nDrone Corvettes are medium-sized drones with a pair of turrets on top and bottom. They come in all variants.\nDrone Frigates are large-sized drones. They carry 9 turrets, unlike player frigates. They come in Light to Command variants.\nDrone Destroyers are extremely large drone ships carrying 8 small and 2 medium turrets. These can be found in wild space, in drone fleets, near drone factories, in drone hideout anomalies, or as escort ships for a drone battleship. They come in Regular to Command variants.\nDrone Cruisers are larger than Drone Destroyers but still only carry 10 turrets, although the turrets are more powerful. Drone Cruisers can only spawn in DH Anomalies in Wild and are a good bit rarer than Drone Battleships as you would need to continuously rejoin the game many times. There are very few videos of these ships due to their rarity and complete removal from Drone Battleship reinforcements. These ships can come in Regular to Command variants, but the Command variant can only be spawned by the developer.\nDrone Battleships are a special, extremely powerful, boss drone that have a 10% chance to spawn from Tier 5 Fleets. For more information, see Drone Battleship. They have only a Regular variant.\n \n \n \nCommand drones appear in the last wave in Drone Fleets, and have a much higher health pool than any other variant. The last wave has an icon with a star symbol on it.\nDrone Squad Leader: Fighter or Interceptor Command Drone. It can spawn in 2-wave and 3-wave fleets.\nDrone Lieutenant: Corvette Command Drone. It can spawn from 3-wave and 4-wave fleets.\nDrone Commander: Frigate Command Drone. It can spawn from 4-wave and 5-wave fleets.\nDrone Captain: Destroyer Command Drone. It can only spawn from 5-wave fleets.\nDrone Admiral: Cruiser Command Drone. It cannot spawn naturally, but can be spawned by the developer.\n \nAncient Drones spawn only in intact X-structures. They have no shield, and and are the only type of drones to use kinetic weaponry. They are the weakest type of drone, with very little hull. They spawn only as fighters and corvettes, but are all named \"Ancient Drone\" regardless of class.\nAncient Drones drop Ancient Drone Cores, trophy items with no use.\nDrone Loot\nDuring the Winter 2020-2021 event (which has ended) Drones had a chance of dropping Snowflake Fireworks.\nDrone Cores will be the same tier as the drone that dropped it (i.e. an Advanced Drone would drop an Advanced Drone Core) and may be sold for credits or turned over to CoreSec Field Offices for CoreSec standing.\nAdvanced and Elite drones often drop a very small amount of Axnit.\nAll Elite Drones, Command Drones, and Drone Battleships have a chance to drop Hybrid blueprints and modules along with Narcor or Red Narcor.\nDrones and Drone Factories have a good chance of dropping scrap or power cells.\nTrivia\nDrone turrets have very simple designs, the barrel being a cylinder and the turret having a spherical space.\nDuring tech week testing, ZolarKeth spawned waves of Drone Battleships at Joama-Sto for the community to fight as a performance test.\nThere was a scrapped drone ship called the Drone Mothership, which spawned as a functionless structure in an unnamed anomaly during Alpha testing.\nThere is also a lesser known Drone Dreadnought, which possibly had an order in the way to destroy it.\nCommand drones are referred to in UI and in-game by ranks rather than the type they are, such as what would otherwise be a Command Drone Corvette being referred to as \"Drone Lieutenant\".\nLight drones are similar to regular drones but weaker in health.\nDrone Admirals do not spawn naturally, but have been spawned by Keth in the test server.\n \n \n \nthumb|A picture of the scrapped drone dreadnought.\nType\nLight/Standard\nAdvanced\nElite\nCommand\nAncient\nTurret\nN/A\nN/A\nFighter\nInterceptor\nN/A\nCorvette\nFrigate\nN/A\nDestroyer\nN/A\nCruiser\n \nN/A\nBattleship\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A",
