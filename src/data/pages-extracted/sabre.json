  "full_text": "Sabre\n\"The Sabre is a powerful ship that makes up for its lack in speed with impressive firepower and tanking ability.\"\nThe Sabre is an entry-level fighter-class ship of the Stronghold ship line. It is best suited as a heavy tank of a fighter, dishing impressive amounts of damage.\nAdvantages\nThe Sabre is one of the tankiest ships of its class, making it exceptional in prolonged engagements and allows it to make good use of resistance and repair modules. The damage the Sabre can dish out is nothing to scoff at, and if it can connect its shots, it can punch much higher than its cost.\nDisadvantages\nThe Sabre is an entry-level ship, and thus will perform poorly against upgraded fightercraft. As a slow fighter, it is easily outmaneuvered and can be hit by heavy warship turrets. Taking a fight in a heavy fighter like the Sabre is dangerous for new pilots, as you have no chance to disengage unless your opponent withdraws or dies.\nTrivia\n- The current Sabre is modeled by AVeryDandyLad.\nFighters\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nLegionis\nAurora\nLuminar\nHybrid Luminar\nStronghold\nSabre\nClaymore\nHybrid Claymore\nMegalodon\nPiranha\nThresher\nMandator\nToucan\nHornbill\nRighteous\nLuster\nLucent\nConstellation\nStratos\nStronghold Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nSabre\nBulwark\nT2\nClaymore\nExotic\nHybrid Claymore",
