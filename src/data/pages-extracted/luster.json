  "full_text": "Luster\n\"The Luster is a Lycentian fighter. This all-around ship is a step ahead of the Aurora which it is derived from.\"\nThe Luster is a T1 fighter-class ship of the Lycentian ship line. It is best suited as a tanky fighter, similar in stats to the Aurora but with improved agility.\nAdvantages\nThe Luster's high shield pool and agility puts it on par with the Aurora despite being a cheap faction fighter, and allows it to do high-level maneuvers that other heavy fighters would not be able to do, while retaining a respectable damage rate. In addition, it's defense rigs lets players further enhance their shield pool.\nDisadvantages\nThe Luster is an T1 faction fighter, and thus will perform poorly against its upgraded counterparts. In addition, a low hull pool causes it to be vulnerable to ion-class weapons due to its shield focus. Despite being more agile than the Aurora, it is still easily outmaneuvered by interceptors or ships with an engine focus.\nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\n- The current Luster is modeled by ii_Cove.\nFighters\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nLegionis\nAurora\nLuminar\nHybrid Luminar\nStronghold\nSabre\nClaymore\nHybrid Claymore\nMegalodon\nPiranha\nThresher\nMandator\nToucan\nHornbill\nRighteous\nLuster\nLucent\nConstellation\nStratos\nRighteous Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nTetra\nLuster\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nDignity\nNobility\nT2\nTriazo\nLucent\nExotic",
