It excels at a burst role, with other ships supporting it so it does not get overwhelmed or outmaneuvered.\nDisadvantages\nDue to its lack of defense rigs, its durability cannot be improved. It serves as somewhat of a glass cannon - while it can deal large amounts of damage, lack of agility makes it vulnerable to being shot down.\nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\n- The current Thresher is modeled by ii_Cove.\nFighters\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nLegionis\nAurora\nLuminar\nHybrid Luminar\nStronghold\nSabre\nClaymore\nHybrid Claymore\nMegalodon\nPiranha\nThresher\nMandator\nToucan\nHornbill\nRighteous\nLuster\nLucent\nConstellation\nStratos\nMegalodon Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nMackeral\nPiranha\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nSunfish\nPtychodus\nT2\nCandiru\nThresher\nExotic",
