  "full_text": "Turrets are an item which can be equipped on any ship with S-turret slots. These include corvettes, frigates, and destroyers. \nThe Exotic versions of Kinetic turrets are Dread and Ancient. Dread is craftable using blueprints from Pirates, and Ancient is uncraftable and can only be found at X-structures. \nThe Exotic versions of Energy turrets are Hybrid, and they are craftable using blueprints from Drones. \nFor information on Medium turrets, see Medium Turrets.\nTurret\nI\nII\nIII\nExotic\nBeam\nKorrelite x60, Reknite x60, Gellium x40\nBeam I, Axnit x60, Narcor x20\nBeam II, Red Narcor 20x\nHybrid\nBeam III, Hybrid Beam Blueprint,\nDrone Core 10x, Power Cell 10x\nCannon\nCannon I, Axnit x60, Narcor x20\nCannon II, Red Narcor 20x\nHybrid\nCannon III, Hybrid Cannon Blueprint, Drone Core 10x, Power Cell 10x\nFlak\nFlak I, Axnit x60, Narcor x20\nFlak II, Red Narcor 20x\nDread\nFlak III, Dread Flak Blueprint,\nMetal scraps 100x, Power Cell 10x\nCoilgun\nCoilgun I, Axnit x60, Narcor x20\nCoilgun II, Red Narcor 20x\nDread\nCoilgun III, Dread Coilgun Blueprint,\nMetal scraps 100x, Power Cell 10x\nAncient\nUncraftable\nRailgun\nRailgun I, Axnit x60, Narcor x20\nRailgun II, Red Narcor 20x\nDread\nRailgun III, Dread Railgun Blueprint,\nMetal scraps 100x, Power Cell 10x\nAncient\nUncraftable\nIon\nIon I, Axnit x60, Narcor x20\nIon II, Red Narcor 20x\nHybrid\nIon III, Hybrid Ion Blueprint, Drone Core 10x, Power Cell 10x\nShrapnel\nShrapnel I, Axnit x60, Narcor x20\nShrapnel II, Red Narcor 20x\nDread\nShrapnel III,Dread Sharpnel Blueprint,Metal scraps 100x, Power cell 10x\nBlaster\nBlaster I, Axnit x60, Narcor x20\nBlaster II, Red Narcor 20x\nHybrid\nBlaster III, Hybrid Blaster Blueprint, Drone Core 10x, Power Cell 10x \nMiner\nMiner I, Axnit x60\nN/A\nN/A\nIce Miner\nMiner II, Red Narcor x10, Heat Sink\nIce Miner I, Ice Miner II Blueprint, Heat Sink, Power Cell x10\nN/A\nN/A\nStrip Miner\nStrip Miner I, Strip Miner II Blueprint, Heat Sink, Power Cell x10\nN/A\nN/A\nPrecision Miner\nPrecision Miner I, Precision Miner II Blueprint, Heat Sink, Power Cell x10\nN/A\nN/A\nProspector\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n\nThe Beam Turret is a slow moving and slow firing turret which, when held down, fires a powerful beam, delivering heavy damage on a successful hit. However, because of damage dropoff over long ranges, it is outperformed by other turrets.\n\nThe Blaster turret has a high rate of fire with a fast turn rate with a fast projectile speed, allowing you to easily shoot down small ships.\n\nThe Cannon Turret has the highest damage per second of any turret. However, it is much slower to turn and fire than Blasters. It is best used against Structures and large, slow enemy ships, where it is hard to miss.\n\nCoilguns deal 1.25x more damage against hull, but 0.65x less damage against shields. It is great for fighting hull-based enemies like Drones or Pirates, but should not be used in PvP because of the ease at which players can regenerate shields.\n\nIon turrets are inverses of coilguns, dealing 1.25x damage against shields and 0.65x damage against hull. Because the vast majority of NPC and player ships are hull-based, Ions are unpopular and rarely used.\n\nFlak Turrets are designed as an antifighter weapon that explodes when a fighter is in the radius of the projectile. It has very low damage, but is great for hitting small, fast fighters.\n\nRailguns are the kinetic counterparts to beams, however they are projectile based and require players to lead their shots in order to hit moving targets. Like other kinetic turrets, these do decreased damage to shields and increased damage to hull. Railguns only fire one shot rather than a burst, unlike the beams.\n\nThe Shrapnel turret acts like a shotgun, being able to deal heavy damage at short range. Despite being a kinetic and dealing less damage to shields, it can be extremely powerful when used correctly.\n\nMiner Turrets are exclusively used for gathering ores. Holding click fires a targeting beam. When it connects with an asteroid, the turret will lock on and fire a mining beam, until the asteroid is depleted, the beam is turned off, or the player moves too quickly for the mining beam to stay on the asteroid. The turret collects around 60-70% of the ore mined (depending on turret tier) and the other 30-40% will be launched from the asteroid.\n\nThe Ice Miner Turret is used to mine water ice at full efficiency, at the cost of mining efficiency for all other ores. Other mining turrets evaporate a significant amount of ice while mining it.\n\nStrip Miner turrets are similar to normal miner turrets, but have a much faster mining rate. However, most of the ore is launched from the asteroid, and will need to be collected with a tractor beam. This turret is great for active mining.\n\nPrecision Miner Turrets are similar to normal miner turrets, with an unimproved mining rate but far higher collection rate. They collect 85%-90% of ore without needing a tractor beam. This turret is great for semi-AFK mining.\n\nLaser color cosmetics purchased in the aesthetics shop will not affect the color of Miner beams.\nThere are 3 types of Exotic tier turrets: Hybrid, Dread, and Ancient. Certain turrets belongs to a certain type; for example, there can be Dread and Ancient Railguns, but not Hybrid ones. Likewise, there are Hybrid Blasters, but no Ancient or Dread variants.\nIt was planned to have a 'tesla' turret, which shoots lightning, built from crystal shards from Crystalline Guardian\n\nNextgenturret",
