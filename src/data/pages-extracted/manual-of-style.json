Always put spaces between the = signs and the title itself.\n- Do not use Fandom's default bullet lists. Use a dash (-) with a space next to it instead.\n- All magic words (things like TOC, NOTOC, or NOEDITSECTION) should be put on the very last lines of the page.\n- Use line breaks liberally - between titles and text and anywhere you feel it is appropriate.
