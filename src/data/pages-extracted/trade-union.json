  "full_text": "Trade Union\nThe Trade Union is a trading faction, located as a small enclave within the galactic core. They are a neutral body, and their freighters can often be found in secure space all across the galaxy, selling tier 1 ship upgrades, armor and furniture, sometimes even selling small fightercraft and haulers.\nThey are a relatively accessible faction for new players, being that it only takes 4 jumps to reach from the Citadel, and they're entirely comprised of secure space where PvP is disabled. Their missions have a unique 25% credit reward increase across all levels, making it a good place to make money during the early game. \nThey have fairly substantial faction rewards, providing blueprints for specialized miner turrets, as well as their own line of haulers with enhanced hauling capacity. Most notable is the reward for reaching the maximum tier with them being the unlocking of their blueprint to build a Galaxy, widely considered one of the best cargo ships in the game due to its large cargo capacity.\nBackground\nThe Interstellar Trade Union is the galaxy's largest commercial and industrial operation, accounting for approximately half of the galactic trade revenue. Union ships have permits to operate in territory controlled by every major galactic power, with taxes imposed on their shipping operations to generate revenue for the factions.\n-The Trade Union's ingame description\n \nMilitary\nThe Trade Union does not have a standing military. They mainly rely on other factions and players for protection from pirates, drones, and other enemies that may threaten them.\nPolitics\nThe Trade Union, as told in the lore section of Starscape, accounts for about half the galactic trading and mining revenue that goes on in the galaxy. They have permits to sell in all factions making them a vital part of all faction economies. Trade Union NPCs only exist as freighters, but the Trade Union offers players blueprints for the Koronis and the Nebula line. Trade Union Freighters can be found quite commonly at Secure, more rarely at Contested and Unsecure, and even more rarely at Unsecures outside the core, including inside Syndicate territory.\nThe Trade Union's number one competitor is the Mining Guild.\nStanding\nMain Article: Standing\nFaction standing represents your relationship with each NPC faction. Completing missions or turning in certain items will increase your standing, while destroying their ships will lower your standing. Standing can be checked from the Career tab.\nStanding Items\nStanding items can be turned in using a Union terminal located in Trade Union branch offices or talking to the Trade Union ambassador located at the Citadel. The Trade Union has the same standing items as the Mining Guild.\nItem\nEffect\nShipping Manifest\n+15\nCrate of Rare Ore\n+30\nCrate of Exotic Goods\n+50\nMissions\nMain Article: Missions\nMissions are granted by agents in branch offices, and require either hauling supplies or completing a combat objective. Higher tier agents require more standing to unlock, but have more difficult missions that give more standing. To access current active missions, go to the Missions tab on the top bar in the inventory.
