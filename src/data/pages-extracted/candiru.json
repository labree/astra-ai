It is best suited as an agile yet heavy-hitting interceptor.\nAdvantages\nWith two weapon rigs and two engine rigs, the Candiru can get astounding mobility while dealing damage higher than many other fighters could. It excels at a striking playstyle, flying in to deal much damage and retreating before reinforcements arrive.\nDisadvantages\nDue to being an interceptor, it is fragile and can be shot down by kinetic weaponry because of its hull focus. Pilots may also find that due to its burst playstyle, the ship overheats too quickly. It does not endure prolonged combat very well, preferring to dart in and out of engagements.\nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\n- The current Candiru is modeled by ii_Cove.\n- The Candiru was named without ZolarKeth's knowledge of the context behind the name.\nInterceptors\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nDefiance\nFalcon\nParagon\nHybrid Paragon\nValiance\nZenith\nPolaris\nHybrid Polaris\nMegalodon\nMackerel\nCandiru\nMandator\nParrot\nMacaw\nRighteous\nTetra\nTriazo\nMegalodon Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nMackeral\nPiranha\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nSunfish\nPtychodus\nT2\nCandiru\nThresher\nExotic",
