  "full_text": "This is a guide with tips on how to edit pages, it is recommended you at least read through all of them and think about it but you are not required to do anything.\n\nEdit already existing pages instead of creating a whole new one, it's easier to not have to mess around with links and categories.\nTry to do one big edit instead of a bunch of small edits, it's fine to continue working on a page and not get the entire thing done but 4 similar small updates within 4 minutes takes up space on the recent changes page and is more annoying to rollback in the event of needing to.\nKeep the page informative, if it is a generally recommended idea to use a specific strategy give reasoning that pertains to actual facts/stats not personal experience(Though this could also be used as reasoning, relying solely on personal experience just makes the article seem bias). On a side note try not to make the page \"personalized\", try to make the article seem like your reading a informative news piece on a recent crime, not a first person retelling of events.\nDon't get into edit wars, this is when 2 or more users cannot agree on an edit and just constantly change the article to what they believe is right.\nIf you want to add cool designs such as infoboxes or other things check out the templates category. As a side note if you understand absolutely nothing about source I do not recommend you mess with it.\nReport anything that you believe is not useful, disrespectful, or generally done with malicious intent. On the other hand just because its a bad edit doesn't mean it requires a report.\nUse the options on the save taskbar to mark it as a minor change, describe what you changed, and if you wanna watch the page. At least make sure to describe what you did in vague terms.\n\nAlways make sure the page you are creating has not been deleted before, or the information intended for the page has not been put elsewhere. If you intend to create a page that has already been deleted in the past I suggest you make it a good page in a short period of time.\nDo a checklist before you create the page to see if the page is really needed.\n1. Is the information intended for this page somewhere else already?\n2. Is the information significant enough or searched for enough to warrant its own page?\nMake sure the title is correct right at the start of making it, it's a hassle to move pages just in general due to a typo.",
