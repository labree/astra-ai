Small ships such as Badger, Aurora, or Bison do not have S turret slots and cannot have S-turrets equipped. For the small autoturrets that some small ships have, see PDT.\nCannon Turret (Small)\nCannon Turrets are energy turrets which have a high damage output, medium range, and below-average reload speed. They are powerful, high-performing turrets, but are not the easiest to use.\nCannons have Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and an Exotic variant. The Exotic variant of a cannon is a Hybrid. Hybrid Cannons must be crafted from Drone Cores, a Tier 3 Cannon, and a Hybrid Cannon blueprint dropped by high-tier Drones and Drone Factories.\nCannon-M Turret (Medium)\nCannon-M turrets are very similar to their S variant. They have greater firepower and lower maneuverability. Medium turrets can only be equipped onto ships with Medium Turret Slots.\nCannon-M turrets can be Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, or an Exotic variant. The Cannon-M's only Exotic variant is Hybrid.
