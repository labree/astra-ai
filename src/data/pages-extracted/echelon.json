  "full_text": "Echelon\n\"The Echelon is a slow and sturdy beast of a warship, capable of withstanding an incredible amount of structural damage before yielding thanks to its redundant hull plating.\"\nThe Echelon is a destroyer-class ship of the Legionis ship line. It is best suited as an armored fleet ship, and while having less total hull than the Bulwark, the other hull tank destroyer, it has a higher armor value. In other words, it will take less damage per shot.\nAdvantages\nThe Echelon, while having less hitpoints than the Bulwark, has an armor rating that boosts its effective HP, especially against low damage high RoF weapons such as Blasters, excelling at taking down weak swarm enemies like drones or fightercraft. This makes it good for Drone Hunting. Unlike the Bulwark, the Echelon has one engine module, which allows it to rival the Bulwark's speed furthermore. It excels at both PVP and PVE depending on the modules and subsystems you have. By augmenting the armor even further through the use of defense rigs, the Echelon can easily tank Drone Factories and Pirate Dens. The Echelon also has the highest energy capacity of any ship in the game, allowing it to run Hull Repairers for substantially longer than other ships that share its role.\nDisadvantages\nThe Echelon's benefits make a slow ship. It is strong in a deployment, but getting it to an area will take effort and time on the pilot's behalf. Due to its reliance on armor and hull, it suffers from high damage per shot weapons such as cannons and kinetic weaponry. Furthermore, it has overall poor turret placement, and the other directions in which it can fire all of its turrets are straight forward or straight backwards- it has poor broadside capabilities. The Echelon's agility is the lowest out of any destroyer, so this means aligning to warp when escaping is slower and harder to do quickly than other Destroyers.\nTrivia\n- The current Echelon is modeled by Drezzlez.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nLegionis Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nAurora\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nT2\nLuminar\nExotic\nHybrid Luminar",
