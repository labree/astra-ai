  "full_text": "Wormholes\nWormholes (officially marked as \"WH\"s) are anomalies that allow fast travel between distant star systems without needing to go through intermediate systems first. They can be found in most star systems with the exception of the Core and Uncharted systems.\nAppearance\nA wormhole will appear as a small, black sphere surrounded by a thin, transparent blue glow over its surface, with a small accretion disk around the equator and two astrophysical jets beaming from the poles. \nFunctionality\n \nWhen hovering your cursor over the wormhole's tag, it will show the security status of the destination. Pressing F will cause you to enter the wormhole. Upon entry, the warp field will differ significantly from the ordinary black and purple stripes seen from a ship's manual warp drive, instead appearing as waves of blue rings falling behind the ship as it travels through the wormhole. The ship's speed meter will also display a speed of \"???\" while using a wormhole. \nIf any Syndicate, Trade Union, or faction-affiliated supply crates are attached to your ship, then some of them will be destroyed upon exiting the wormhole. This does not apply to Spice or CoreSec supply crates, however. \n \nDepending on their stability, wormholes will disappear after a period of 48 or 336 hours (2 days to 2 weeks) after spawning. The stability of the wormhole can be checked by pressing 'C' with the cursor on the wormhole; a \"semi-stable\" wormhole lasts 2 days, and a \"remarkably stable\" wormhole lasts 2 weeks. When a wormhole is nearing collapse (24 hours left), the wormhole's tag's description and lifespan estimate will change to indicate its instability.\n \nAs wormholes collapse, they rapidly shrink into nothing and disappear from the anomaly's space. While wormholes cannot collapse while ships are using them, they can still collapse after the ship has exited warp, meaning that using unstable wormholes carries a significant risk of stranding the player in unsafe territory and is generally not recommended. \nTrivia\nThis is the only spatial phenomenon in the game as of the Getting Around update.\nIf a wormhole collapses as you are entering it, you will be teleported to a random planet in the destination's star system.",
