  "full_text": "Regions are finite, unchanging areas on the map with a set number of systems. Sectors exist only in The Core, in all other regions, the sector only shows up as 'sector' and do not appear on the map. There are a total of 9 regions, 8 of which are in wild space.\n\nThe Core contains all three of the warring factions, as well as the trade union. It spans across 800 systems, making it the largest region. None of the region's systems are wild, and it contains all of the galaxy's contested systems. The region is the only one to bear named sectors, of which it has 11.\nIn-game description:\n\"The Core is by far the most densely-populated region of the galaxy. It emanates outward from its central point: The Citadel, which serves as the administrative and operational hub of CoreSec, a treaty organization tasked with defending humanity both from itself and any external threats.\nBeyond the border of the the CoreSec Non-Aligned Territories lie the galaxy's three great powers: The Lycentian Federation, the Kavani Mandate, and the Foralkan Empire. These three nations exist in a perpetual state of conflict stemming back hundreds of years, only rarely pausing their warring to cooperate long enough to push back significant incursions from the drones.\nThe core is a hub of commerce, wealth, and civilization. As such, the risks posed to pilots within it are minimal and primarily take the forms of piracy in the region's unsecure systems, and warfare in the border regions between the three nations.\"\n\nIn clockwise order, starting from galactic north\nInner Core\nCatalyst\nSentinel\nSchism\nEmpyrean Highlands\nHarvest\nPassage\nValence\nSecond Mandate\nFirst Mandate\nContact\n\nWildar is a region in wild space that contains the Syndicate.
