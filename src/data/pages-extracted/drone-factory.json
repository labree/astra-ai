  "full_text": "Drone Factories are destructible structures that spawn Drones and contain nice loot. Previous to the 1.7.0 update, Drone Factories were indestructible generated structures that spawned drones for players to farm. \n\nDrone Factories are in Warp Hub and Ring areas over many planets and in a good portion of rings. They have 4 different tiers: Depot, Foundry, Factory, and Megacomplex. Higher level factories call stronger drones, take longer to destroy, and have better loot. However, it is still possible to get hybrids from Depots. \nDrone Factories have three types of parts: Shield Generators, Power Regulators and the Main Reactor. The Shield Generators must be destroyed to allow the Power Regulators to be damaged, and the Power Regulators must be destroyed to allow the Main Reactor to be damaged. When the Main Reactor is destroyed, the factory explodes and can be looted.\nThe Main Reactor is always located at the top of the drone factory, protected by a red shield until all the Shield Generators and Power Regulators have been destroyed. Shield Generators and Power Regulators are symmetrically arranged across the factory.\nEvery time a part is destroyed, excluding the Main Reactor, a wave of drones, whose strength is relative to the factory tier, will warp in to defend the factory. Waves also warp in on a timer regardless of parts being destroyed.\n\n \nLevel 1 Drone Depots are the weakest and most common factories. They spawn standard drones and occasional turrets. It is generally easy to destroy all the drones if you have a corvette, and it is possible even in a fighter. Depots typically drop Power Cells, several regular Drone Cores, and around 50 Axnit, as well as a small chance of a Hybrid module or blueprint.\nDepots have:\n1 Shield Generator\n1 Power Regulator\n1 Main Reactor\nThe Shield Generator is on one side and the Power Regulator is on the other. The Main Reactor is accessible from the top.\nDrone Depots can only spawn in Secure, Unsecure, Contested, and — on very rare occasions — Wild Systems.\nThey can spawn up to Advanced Drone Frigates.1\n\n \nLevel 2 Drone Foundries are slightly bigger drone factories, but still fairly weak. Corvettes and Frigates work well against them. Foundries typically drop Power Cells, several Advanced Drone Cores, and either ~70 Axnit or ~50 Narcor, as well as a chance of a Hybrid module or blueprint.\nFoundries have:\n1 Shield Generator\n2 Power Regulators\n1 Main Reactor\nThe Shield Generator is on one side, and the two Power Regulators are on the other. The Main Reactor is accessible from the top.\nDrone foundries can spawn in Secure, Contested, Unsecure, and Wild space.\nThey can spawn Elite Drone Frigates.1\n \n\nLevel 3 Drone Factories are a common sight in Wild systems. Frigates or destroyers are recommended for Drone Hunters wanting to take one of these down. Factories typically drop Power Cells, some Advanced Drone Cores, some Elite Drone Cores, and ~90 Narcor, as well as a good chance of one or two Hybrid modules or blueprints.\nFactories have:\n2 Shield Generators\n4 Power Regulators\n1 Main Reactor\nThe Shield Generators are on either side. Two Power Regulators are on top, and two are on the bottom. The Main Reactor is accessible from the top.\nDrone factories can spawn in Unsecure, Contested, and Wild systems.\nThey can spawn up to Elite Drone Destroyers.\n \n\nLevel 4 Drone Megacomplexes are the strongest and rarest type of factory. You generally need a destroyer to take one down, or be very skilled with a frigate. Megacomplexes drop Power Cells, several Drone Command Cores, ~50 Red Narcor, and often multiple Hybrid modules or blueprints.\nMegacomplexes have:\n4 Shield Generators\n6 Power Regulators\n1 Main Reactor\nTwo Shield Generators are on top and two are on the bottom. 3 Power Regulators are on each side. The Main Reactor is accessible from the top.\nDrone Megacomplexes can only spawn in Wild systems.\nThey can spawn up to Elite Drone Destroyers.\n\nPrior to the 1.7.0 update, factories were not destructible and would constantly spawn drones around it whose numbers were based on the factory tier. In addition, their primary color was white instead of black.\nDrone factories in general usually have better loot than Drone Fleets, and are also easier to deal with.\nShip recommendations given above are for brawling the factory- any warship or subcapital can destroy the factory from far away using ranged weapons such as Railguns or Beams. This means that theoretically, a corvette, or even a Stratos with pulse weapons, could destroy a Megacomplex.",
