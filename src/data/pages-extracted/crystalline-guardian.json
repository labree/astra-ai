  "full_text": "Crystalline Guardian\n \nAcrisilex, or Crystalline Guardians (Referred to as ??? in-game), are NPC ships that spawn in VX anomalies and Vexnium deposits. Each Vexnium field will have anywhere from 2 to 5 of these ships within them, roughly proportional to the number of Vexnium asteroids generated. Their hitpoints are hull-only and have no shields, and they possess powerful weapons that fire high-damage lightning bolts at any players attempting to mine Vexnium. \nWhen destroyed, Crystalline Guardians always drop a single Crystal Shard, a component item with no current use in any recipes.\nBehavior\n\nActivation\nUpon first appearing in an anomaly/aberration, the guards are dormant, and resemble a single, large, blue crystal. Once a piece of Vexnium is mined, all guardians in the asteroid field awaken. Any guardians in range of the player will immediately fire at the player which mined the Vexnium, regardless of other players in the area. A loud screech is heard which indicates activation, with the now active guardians receiving red icons with a label of three question marks (\"???\"). \nArmament\nThese ships use ion (shield-damaging) weapons that will fire in three high-damage bursts. Each bolt has an incredibly high speed and can do up to about 300 hitpoints of splash damage from the point of impact (indicated by smaller bolts emanating from the point). They have a maximum range of about 5,000 meters, or roughly the same range as beams and railguns.\nActive Behavior\nOnce active, the guardians will fire at any players in range (even if they did not mine the Vexnium themselves) in an attempt to run them out of the asteroid field, indicated by field borders a short distance from the outer Vexnium asteroids. When no players are in the field, the ships remain activated, but start to wander at a slow pace within the field borders. When a player is detected within the borders once again, one or more guardians will travel towards the player and begin firing once within range, no matter if they were provoked or not.\nDeactivation\nAfter 30 minutes of peace, guardians will deactivate and return to their original, dormant state. However, they can be reactivated by mining another piece of Vexnium.\nCombat Strategies\n\nSolo\nFighting guardians alone is incredibly difficult without a powerful, decked-out warship. It is recommended to have a frigate or destroyer armed with coilguns that can withstand the high damage and deal heavy damage to their shieldless hulls.\nIf you lack a ship capable of tanking damage, however, kiting with beams and railguns is also viable though it is much slower and requires a different playstyle to work effectively.\nFor a more experienced player, a Yukon with coilguns and a Hull Repairer module may be a viable option. Nevertheless, the process is also quite slow as it necessitates kiting due to the ship's lower survivability and damage output compared to purpose-built combat destroyers.\nSquad\nA team of players makes these difficult enemies significantly easier. Use the same tools listed above, but in greater numbers, and be careful to avoid friendly fire.\nTrivia\nThe term \"Crystalline Guardian\" was coined by the community due to the fact that they're considered the \"guardians\" of the Vexnium along with the crystal shards that would drop upon death.\nThese ships are officially known as the Acrisilex in the game files. They are classified as creatures, indicating that they could be extraterrestrial lifeforms.\nDisclaimer: This is not public knowledge and was obtained through data mining of the game files. Thus, this should be treated as non-canon due to possible changes at any time.\nWhen the hull of a Crystalline Guardian is breached, the guardians emit a blue fire rather than the orange fire that emits from normal ships. They also have a blue explosion effect and different killsound in contrast to the orange explosion effect for all other ships when destroyed.\nCrystalline Guardians are one of only three classes of enemies in the game to have their own battle theme (Dark Ties), the others being the three faction battleships and the Drone Battleship.",
