It is best suited as a fast mining ship.\nAdvantages\nThe Mako is still reasonably cheap compared to warship miners, allowing it to get in spaces larger ships could not. With two engine slots, it can greatly reduce its signal range or warp charge time, making it good at mining in more dangerous zones such as near NPC structures. The Mako also boasts the fastest warp speed in the game.\nDisadvantages\nThe Mako is fragile due to its durability being traded for its speed, and a stray volley can easily destroy it.
