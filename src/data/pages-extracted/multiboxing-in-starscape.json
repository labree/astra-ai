  "full_text": "Multiboxing in Starscape\nMultiboxing is the act of playing the game using multiple Roblox accounts at once. Some players find this incredibly useful, as they can scout and obtain vital information without risking valuable ships, or quickly earn a large amount of credits. As such, if you wish to advance quickly, multiboxing is a skill to consider, if not outright adopt, if you have the means to do so. \nLegality\nMultiboxing is not considered to be exploiting as long as the accounts are not automated. You can run as many accounts as you want as long as a human being is in control of them at all times.\nIn terms of Roblox TOS, multiboxing exists in a gray area. The roblox client does not normally allow for multiple games to be run at once on the same computer, but the community standards states that the only kind of cheating/exploiting that will be met with any kind of suspension is one that \"gives an unfair advantage\". It's debatable whether or not multiboxing violates this when you can accomplish the same thing with just two different computers. Not to mention, it's not even clear why the engine is restricted this way - perhaps the roblox devs did it for technical reasons instead of concerns for cheating.\nIn general, Roblox is unlikely to ban you for using a technique that's already permitted by the game itself. But it should still be stressed for the sake of the wiki: Anyone who uses the methods outlined below assumes all risk.\nMethods\n\nMultiple computers\nUsing more than one computer is always an option, especially for individuals with an old computer lying around, which may not have anything better to be doing then rusting in a closet. While this may be a luxury for most players, some have the extra laptops running around to do this, and it is probably the simplest of the three to get working. Simply have another Roblox account, download Roblox for that computer, and start playing on both computers at once. This has the disadvantages of requiring multiple computers being already in your possession, and that it may be more difficult to cycle through both computers as they run. However, people with several weaker computers can execute this well enough if they can't do the below strategies, and it works well enough for what it is.\nMicrosoft Store Roblox client (Windows only)\nFor individuals using Windows 10, they have a way of having two Roblox games open at the same time, with little fuss. As part of Microsoft's push to become a gaming hub, they offer Roblox as an item on their store, which uses different software from the Roblox you may normally download online. Because of this, having both installed means you can play both the Online download, and the Microsoft Store version on the same computer, which means you now have two Roblox applications open. This is stackable with Multi-Computer Multiboxing if you do not wish to bother with the third type of Multiboxing.\nHowever, it should be noted that the Store version of Roblox often doesn't play nice with Starscape - Some installations won't lock the cursor, which can make some ships unusable. And there appears to be no official solution to this other than \"just use the web version lol\". So your mileage may vary.\nThird-party multiboxing applications\nAny kind of application that can force the Roblox client to allow multiple instances on the same computer falls under this category. Many of these applications that brand themself as \"roblox hacks\" or are pushed by clickbait youtube tutorials are rather sketchy and flagged by antivirus software. If you're lost for which of these to use, it's recommended to ask more experienced players to learn which are safe and which aren't.\nFor the technically inclined, the RobloxPlayerBeta executable has a handle which is named \"ROBLOX_singletonEvent\". Opening Roblox and then closing this handle will allow a second client to be started without the first automatically closing. Many off-the-shelf process managers (such as this one provided officially by Microsoft) can do this for you.\nApplications\nSo now you have several tabs of Roblox open. Now what?\nTo start with, get used to switching between tabs. Managing your tabs is vital to successful multiboxing, such as figuring out where they are and being able to remember what that account was last doing. Give it some practice and see what you are and are not capable of. \nMass Transit\nThe first thing to practice is Warp Juggling. Warp Juggling is warping several accounts at once to various or a single location. This is simple enough, and can be executed for up to 5 accounts reasonably, although 2 to start with is preferred. Make sure to set a location with safest route (since your ability to respond to danger is reduced), and with the volume on, check in whenever a ship exits warp, and set it to commence the next jump. This allows for the mass transit of several things at once, such as miners to far out places, haulers to desirable locations, and scouts to interesting sectors, all in a fraction of the time as doing them individually. \nMake sure you pay attention to your ships. Sectors have drones, and you'll often find yourself distracted by something else, only to hear beeping or explosions as your ship begins to get shredded. If this happens, warp it to another planet quickly.\nAlso note that you are effectively doubling your chance of encountering pirates, simply because you are doubling the amount of ships you have going places, simply by the fact that you are adding the chance you would of encountered a pirate on the first trip, with the chance of the second. Instead, you're doing them at the same time. But, try and make relatively safe journeys when possible, even along inefficient routes, and don't be disheartened if you encounter a pirate; odds are, you would've seen them anyways on a solo trip.\nNext is Scouting, which is useful specifically for combat ventures. By flying a Stratos into a potentially dangerous system, you ensure one of your players don't have to check (meaning you have more guns for the fight). Otherwise, since scouting is extremely important for all things combat-related, it makes gathering information easier. These alts can also be placed in sectors to watch for activity, such as in the sector before Gatinsir to ensure that no surprise fleets show up to ruin your adventure.\nCombat Multiboxing\nMultiboxing for Combat usually isn't the best idea, but can be substantial in some unique scenarios. The most infamous is soloing a Drone Battleship, where an individual with several frigates, a lot of balls, and 8 hours to burn, can on their own defeat a Drone Battleship by cycling frigates over and over again (or just use a beam destroyer). However, PvP combat and multiboxing do not mix well, due to the reaction speed required for PvP, so the best use of Multiboxing for Combat is by utilizing alts as reserves, where when one alt is sent back to the Citadel (voluntarily or not), another alt is ready to warp in and finish the job. \nMultiple alts can also be a nice intimidation tactic, just make sure you don't name them after a theme. But, a pirate warping in on 10 individuals all from the same faction and looking like different people would be quite terrifying for the pirate indeed. Or a luxury. It's a 50/50 shot.\nMultiboxing Mining\nMultibox mining is the most obvious use of Multiboxing, where in this game that mining does not require too much engagement when it comes to Corvette and Frigate miners, multiple Corvette or Frigate miners can all be going at once. \nAFK Mining is the process of minimizing the interaction you need to give your miner in order to yield at least some of the resources you normally would. This is done by performing a minor glitch, where by holding the key for firing the miner turrets, and by pressing escape, you end up tricking the game into thinking it's still holding down the fire button. Then, by aiming behind asteroids, you can make it so the turrets each have their own asteroid to mine. By tricking the game into thinking you are continuously firing, you also can then look at an additional asteroid, which the turrets would all go to and start to mine when they are done. This does mean you have to forgo a Tractor, which means you lose 30% of your ore yield, but this can be mitigated by using precision miners to increase the rate of ores automatically being collected.\nThe math behind this is interesting. By sacrificing 30% of the yield you would get by being engaged and using a tractor, you instead gain large amounts of freetime, while you yield 70% of the resources. This can be frustratingly low with one miner (although quite nice to do when you have something else to be doing), but that time can be spent maneuvering another miner to also begin mining. As such, by sacrificing 30% of your gain, you are now getting 40% more total what you would be getting from being engaged with a tractor, all for the price of another mining vessel. Keep stacking up to the 4 miners one can comfortably do, and now you're getting 280% the resources a normal individual would receive an hour.\nThere are two schools of thought, both with drawbacks and benefits:\nBulk Anomaly Mining - By utilizing probes and parking your miner in an asteroid field, you gain better ores on average and do not need to worry about NPCs. This comes at the cost of having to focus more on each miner in order to find anomalies.\nBulk System Mining - By bringing an escort ship, you can park in a planetary asteroid field and mine all the asteroids present, with nearly continuous efficiency, but lower quality ore. This does mean you have to have a combat ship however, which you switch to in order to get rid of spawning drones.\nWhen your ships are filled, send out a Hauler to pick it up rather then bringing the miners back. You can package items to the Cargo Holds on a Hauler to maximize the space you can carry, and the miners can keep mining without getting endangered by crossing into unsecured territory. It also makes it easier to get everything to your main account, since you are collecting everything directly.\nAlways mine using alts. Even if you aren't multiboxing, your main account should always be free to participate in faction activities, trade, and do other wonderful stuff.",
