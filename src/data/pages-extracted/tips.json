  "full_text": "Tips\nThis page contains tips and advice that are too short for their own pages.\nProbe Safety\nIn Wild space, many players find it difficult to safely scan for anomalies due to the large Drone/Pirate presence at most planets.\nThe solution is to probe while warping. Launch a probe, and then warp to another planet before the probe minimap comes up. Navigate the probe while you warp. When you exit warp, briefly close the minimap and warp to another planet. Open the minimap again to continue probing the system. If you find a safe anomaly (anything except BF/DH/SP, and sometimes VX if someone mined there without killing the guards), warp there and stay while probing.\nAll hostile NPCs will wait 5-7 seconds before attacking you after you warp in, unless you start firing. To prevent accidentally firing your weapons, follow these steps as soon as you warp in:\nPress N, note the planet you are arriving at and the planet farthest from it\nPress down CTRL\nLong click on the probe icon until it launches\nRelease CTRL\nWarp to the farthest planet using the Quick Warp Menu (SPACE)\nDo low-risk mining in Contested Systems\nContested systems have similar loot/resource pools to Unsecure systems and are much safer if you are enlisted in a faction. You can find better ores than in Secure systems, without risking permanent ship death in Wild space. Nonetheless, make sure to warp out/safelog if an unenlisted/enemy player warps in, as they can still attack your ship.\nAvoid pirate hotspots\nGatinsir, Aerelret, Stoyd Ydase, Eod'taost, Emas, Vlasium, Cid Tapa, and Muex are common systems for pirates to gather. You will almost certainly be killed if you try to pass through them. Do not enter any unsecure system, especially those in the inner core, with ships you can't afford to lose. Warp disruption is enabled in these systems. If a group of pirates disrupt and attack you, there is almost no chance of survival regardless of your ship. Do not believe players who tell you that these systems are the easiest way to find rare ores: this is a trick to get you killed. If you need to pass through these systems, store all your items in storage, then travel through quickly in a disposable ship.\nDon't leak your location\nWhenever you post a screenshot to any Discord server, make sure that your current system and your destination is not included unless you want to be killed. If you post a screenshot bragging about your ore haul in a wild system and people can see where you are, pirates will try to intercept you on your way back into secure space. You could end up losing the very ore haul you were showing off. To hide your location, enter Cinematic Mode by pressing Shift + Tab. This will hide all UI including your location and destination. You can also post the screenshot once you are in a safe system if you would like to show the UI.\nBe careful with wormholes near the core\nThe closer a wormhole is to a core system, the more likely it is that someone else has already found it or will find it soon. Wormholes from systems close to the core to wild space can be risky because pirates are also very likely to find them. Stable wormholes (those which can last for up to 2 weeks) are also risky to use, as there is more time for people to find them. Some pirates deploy many warp disruptor bubbles in a wild system that has a wormhole to a Secure system near the Citadel to trap players, so if you are going through these wormholes, scout with a disposable ship (such as the Stratos) first.\nDon't sell items to NPCs\nSelling your items in the player market will always increase your profit by a significant margin. You will have the easiest time selling your items in the player markets at The Citadel and Quarry. NPC Prices are very low and poor estimates of what the item is actually worth, so you should never sell it to NPCs or price your items using NPC rates as a guide.\nBe careful fighting drone fleets/factories alone\nDrone fleets consist of multiple wave of high-tier drones which can destroy your ship very quickly. Even strong frigates can be killed in seconds by the later waves. Furthermore, even if you manage to destroy a whole tier 4 (still, this is unfeasible unless you are in a frigate or a destroyer) fleet by yourself, there is a 10% chance that a drone battleship will spawn and kill you before you can warp away in tier 5 fleets. These battleships are so strong that they normally take a few experienced players in destroyers with high-level turrets/modules to destroy them. Watch your health, and warp to another planet to regen shield/hull if needed. Drone Captains and Commanders can kill you easily even on their own, so be careful if you plan on baiting them out of their fleets. A drone captain is capable of destroying a full decked out destroyer, so exit the game or warp to another planet if you are badly hulled.\nNever go AFK in combat-enabled systems\nWhether this may be just going AFK in any system except for core (providing you aren't an enemy of that faction) or just going afk while warping. Players or NPCs may fire on your ship while you are away. Especially in unsecure and wild systems where you can warp into a system with a drone or pirate fleet which might kill you before you have a chance to warp out. Even if you are at a planet that does not have any drones, it is possible that drones will warp into the system while you are away and destroy your ship. The point is never go AFK unless you are in a core system unless you are enemies with that faction or you are in certain anomalies like WH's, AT's, AL's, and CM's.\nTrust no one by default\nAnyone in this game can be a pirate who is out to get you. Regardless of who they claim to be, do not trust them unless they are in your faction or an allied faction (shown in the player list as cyan or blue). You can also trust people that you know in real life. Be careful trusting people you meet in secure systems, as they may be trying to lure you into a trap. When you meet apparently friendly people in secure and follow them to wild space, you give them a chance to destroy your ship.\nYou also should never accept squad invites from unknown players because they can use these to track you down and kill you. It is safe to stay in secure, but if they tell you to go to an unsecure or wild system, don't go there (unless you are in a Stratos with no valuable items in your inventory), as if they are a faction member, they can call their allies to kill you and obtain your items.\nIf you encounter another player in a unsecure/wild system, be cautious. They could be a miner or a pirate. Unless you are looking for a fight, it's best not to find out. Warp away as soon as an unknown name appears on the player list.\nTag aggressive players\nWhile you are warping away to another system, mark an aggressive player's name in red. You will immediately be able to identify them if you encounter them in the future.\nDon't craft ships in piracy hotspots\nA pirate can join, enter the industrial station that your ship is being crafted in, and when you join back, they could camp the crafting terminal and try to kill you to acquire your vessel.\nPractice PvP combat\nPractice combat with your friends/allies to learn how to fight back against enemies.\nUse timezones to your advantage\nMost Starscape players are American. A smaller, but still significant, number are based in Western Europe. To avoid players, play at night or in the morning in these timezones (UTC 08:00 to 12:00), on weekdays if possible. Do attempt to avoid playing on holidays. (Mainly American and Canadian Holidays)\nConversely, if you want to meet more players (for PvP or piracy), play during weekend/holiday afternoons in these timezones. \nBe nice to others\nYou will meet people who have lost their ship in wild systems, or new players who don't know what to do. If you are able, help them get ahead by giving them tips, duelling them to train their combat skills, and giving ships/items. It costs nothing to be kind.\nEngage in financial practices\nThese practices help to guide the player in maintaining a stable economic life. \nHaving backup and reserve resources and credits goes a long way. You will never know when you might lose your ship/items, and when you do, you can always count on your reserves to help you recover from such losses. That is why saving stuff in this game is important, where it can range from spare turrets, spare ores to allocating a portion of your credits to recovery expenses. If you do not do this, you will have to spend a lot of money and resources which might be detrimental.\nBefore you sell/buy items, you should try to review the existing prices offered for that item and compare it to your price. Additionally you may want to ask experienced players for the itemâ€™s worth before trying to engage in a sale so that you can maximize profit and value from sales. For example, selling items at higher prices to get more credits and buying items at cheaper prices to spend less credits.\nFocus on corvettes as your first warship\nWhile destroyers and frigates are the flashy and ultimate end-game ships, the grind for them is long and you want to start out small first. Corvettes are great ships that are always reliable at any stage of the game whether its early-game or late-game. Corvettes are great ships to fall back on if you need to use smaller ships to get work done. Many experienced players and PVP fighters use corvettes as they are versatile in the battlefield. Due to their faster speed and maneuverability, they can even take down frigates and destroyers if used well! Corvette-size miners and haulers are great for starting out to make more credits or acquire ships and resources.",
