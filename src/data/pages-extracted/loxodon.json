  "full_text": "Loxodon\n\"The Loxodon represents the Foralkan Armada's dedication to firepower, using its medium turret slots to great advantage.\"\nThe Loxodon is a destroyer-class ship of the Megalodon ship line. It is best suited as a glass cannon destroyer, able to throw out overwhelming damage but not able to take much in return.\nAdvantages\nThe Loxodon's damage focus is absurd, and its main strategy relies on causing the enemy to panic. Combined with stasis and overclocker subsystems, no ship can endure the full onslaught of a Loxodon. This also makes the Loxodon an excellent siege ship, staying out of range while devastating structures.\nIts main focus is being an aggressive powerhouse, mainly best in PvE with cannons and other high dps guns.\nDisadvantages\nThe Loxodon is fragile, as a glass cannon, and a level-headed pilot can take advantage of this to force it to retreat or kill it entirely. It suffers from poor turret placement as well, and can be swarmed or outmaneuvered easily.\nThe Loxodon has a pitifully small health pool for a ship its size, with almost no focus on defense. Combined with its poor mobility, getting kited in a Loxodon is almost always a guaranteed death. The Loxodon, being a hull based ship, should also be wary of kinetic weapons.\nTo counter these weaknesses, Loxodons should be used in a fleet. The sheer mass of the Loxodons combined will negate the small health pool, and the tremendous outgoing damage easily break apart any fleet. \nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\n- The current Loxodon is modeled by AVeryDandyLad.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nMegalodon Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nMackeral\nPiranha\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nSunfish\nPtychodus\nT2\nCandiru\nThresher\nExotic",
