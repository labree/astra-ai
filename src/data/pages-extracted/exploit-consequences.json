  "full_text": "Exploit Consequences\n\nCheats and Exploits\n\nBannable Offenses\nExploiting is an action when a player uses hacks from third party software, as well as features, to obtain in-game advantages. As stated by Starscape's DARE (Devs Against Raging Exploiters) policies, \"...in-game exploitation via third-party exploit programs is an in-game bannable offense, with few exceptions...\" Bannable offenses include, but are not limited to, exploiting in-game bugs to dupe items or movement-related cheats. However, reporting an exploitable bug will not end in a ban. \"Intentional, repeated use of in-game bugs (such as a dupe glitch) to gain an advantage may still result in a ban depending on the severity of the issue. However, cooperating with devs during exploit investigations will drastically reduce your chances of being banned.\"\nNon-punishable Offenses\nThird-party programs may be used to scrape publicly-available data such as galaxy map information, faction warfare related data like capture timers, and market data (automating buy/sell orders is still prohibited). Multiboxing, however, is allowed as long as accounts are not automated. Graphical improvements are also permitted. \nAnti-Cheat\nStarscape has anti-exploit bots that will kick players from the game for varying amounts of time, usually several minutes, if it detects something unusual. This could be due to abnormal lag, lagspikes/lagswitching, abnormal movement, or exploits. Abnormal movement, in particular, can be a result of movement hacks or simply falling out of stations. To avoid triggering the anti-cheat, try to play with a stable internet connection. To avoid triggering the anti-cheat when under high ping, avoid movement to allow for the server to catch up with the client.",
