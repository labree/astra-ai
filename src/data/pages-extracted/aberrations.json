  "full_text": "Aberrations\nThis article is about planetary aberrations. For the system locations see Anomalies.\nA planetary Aberration is the planetary variant of system anomalies, they can be found by using a Planet Probe Scanner to scan a planet while you are there. Similar to anomalies, aberrations are named with a letter and a random 3-digit number (for example, X-545).\nThere are 2 types of Aberrations:\nR-Deposits\nDeposits are asteroid fields that can only be found in rings and contain massive amounts of high quality ore of a single type; Korrelite, Reknite, Gellium, Axnit and Narcor*. Additionally, Vexnium can spawn in Deposits, but to mine it you will have to fight or otherwise avoid Crystalline Guardians like in VX anomalies. \n* Red and Blue Narcor spawn in the same aberration.\nX-Structures\nStructures are large, abandoned, and wrecked structures presumably built thousands of years ago for an unknown purpose. These may contain both locked and unlocked crates of loot. Locked crates must be \"hacked\" to access its contents. Once you have looted all the crates, the X-Structure becomes deadspace. There are ancient ships that have been destroyed around these structures. With the exception of the large shipwreck in the Ancient Shipyard, all of these ships appear to be the wrecks of Ancient Drones. Depending on which types of X-structures you come across, there may be 3 to 7 crates. Note that open crates may or may not be empty, and, if another player has already looted some of the crates, there may only be a few with loot. All hackable crates, once hacked, are guaranteed to yield loot, varying from simple scraps to items of higher rarity such as Red Narcor or even ancient turrets or modules.\n \nFor more information regarding aberrations, refer to this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsT_MbRC6DM.
