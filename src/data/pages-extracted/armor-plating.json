  "full_text": "Armor plating\nArmor rating and deflection are two defensive ship stats that are somewhat poorly explained within the game itself. Both stats reduce damage per shot by 1 per unit - Armor only affects hull damage and Deflection only affects shield damage.\nEach ship has a different armor and deflection rating. They significantly lower damage from damage sources which focus on high rate of fire, low damage (such as weak turrets or ships such as low tier interceptors).\nNote that in the case of warship combat, the damage reduced is calculated per each turret., including ones that fire multiple shots from the same turret (i.e coilguns).\nAs a practical example, say a Conciliator with a full complement of Blaster 3's fires upon a hulled Echelon, and each shot lands (and no rigs or subsystems are involved that can interfere with our numbers).\nThe combined damage of 4 Blaster 3's and 2 Blaster-M 3's is 136. The Echelon has an armor rating of 6.5, and since we're taking into account 6 turrets in total here, the amount of damage reduced is 6*6.5 = 39. The Echelon will take 97 damage in total (or roughly 29% less than what it would have without armor).\nComposite Armor\nThere is a Composite Armor defense rig that idly increases the armor rating of a ship. This can reduce damage by a small amount, and can make extremely low damage shots entirely harmless.\nThis has a variant which is only obtainable from X-structures, and comes in three sizes: Light, Medium, and Heavy.\nComposite Armor types\nName\nArmor Boost\nAgility debuff\nI\n+1.5\n-5%\nII\n+2\n-5%\nIII\n+2.5\n-5%\nAncient\n+3\n-5%\nAncient Armor Booster\nThere is an Ancient Armor Booster subsystem that, when activated, increases armor for a set amount of time with a cooldown and an energy activation cost.
