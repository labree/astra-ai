  "full_text": "Pirates\nThis article is about the NPC ship type. It is not to be confused with the player activity of Piracy.\nPirates are an NPC that appear randomly in Contested, Unsecure, and Wild systems in fleets. There are also Pirate Dens that may spawn in Secure, Unsecure, Contested, and Wild systems which are guarded by pirate ships. Pirate ships also appear in Trade Union and Mining Guild combat missions, but only regular variants spawn. \nThere are six known classes of pirate ships: fighters, interceptors, miners, corvettes, frigates, and destroyers. In addition, they come in five tiers: Light, Normal, Steeled, Dread, and Command. \nThe fighters and interceptors consist of Falcon, Zenith, Aurora, and Sabre variants. The pirate miners take shape as Badgers or Marlins and can only be found at the beginning of Law Enforcement missions. The pirate corvettes are Radixes, Chevrons, and Infinities. Pirate frigates are Phalanxes, Halos, and Adamants. Pirate Destroyers appear as Echelons, Bulwarks, Fortitudes, and Horizons. \nPirate AI behaves much like drone AI, attacking any other non-pirate ship on sight, including drones and faction ships. Pirate ships can drop a variety of items when destroyed, including credits, scrap, power cells, refined materials, and standing items such as Stolen Artifact crates, Crates of Exotic Goods, Crates of Rare Ores, and Contraband Weapons. These crates are not openable, and are just items to turn in to factions to increase standing. In addition, Dread pirates can rarely drop Dread blueprints and modules.\nA Regular pirate ship would have 1/5 the health points of the ship it represents. A Steeled pirate ship would have half the health points compared to the ship it represents, a Dread pirate ship would have the same amount of health points as the ship it represents, while Ethereal Pirates (now removed from the game) would be twice as strong as the ship it represents.\nClass\nShip\nRegular\nSteeled\nDread\nCommand\nMiner\nMarlin\nN/A\nBadger\nN/A\nInterceptor\nFalcon\nZenith\nFighter\nAurora\nSabre\nCorvette\nRadix\nInfinity\nChevron\nFrigate\nHalo\nAdamant\nPhalanx\nDestroyer\nHorizon\nFortitude\nBulwark\nEchelon\nIf part of this chart is blank, feel free to get a picture and fill it.\nEthereal Event\nA Halloween event ran from 10/30/2020 to 11/6/2020 which introduced a limited-time skin known as “Ethereal.” It is a gold tier-5 item that gave the ship type it belonged to a glowing neon green appearance, and was dropped from Ethereal pirates. Each item has its own ship-specific skin which can be applied to that specific ship. For example, if an Ethereal Pirate had dropped an Ethereal Kodiak skin, that skin can only be applied to Kodiaks. Each skin is a one-time use, and can be bought and sold on the player market. Because of their rarity, they are quite expensive.\nTrivia\nWhile both Drones and Pirates are both hostile to the player, they also will fight each other, since Drones seem to attack all humans and pirates are humans.\nPirate fleets were added in the Getting Around update. This update also added classes of Pirate Interceptors, as well as the chance for Interceptors to spawn at dens. Along with this, Pirate Command ships were in addition to the game.\nPirate ships are stronger than Drone ships; for example, a Pirate Frigate will be significantly more durable and dangerous than a Drone Frigate.\nPirate ships use random mixes of both kinetic and energy weapons for all types of turrets.\nOccasionally, Pirate patrols (referring to pirate fleets that spawn without the fleet event) may warp into contested system generators and attack it.",
