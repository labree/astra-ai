Some Gunships will also use fixed hardpoints when they are eventually added to the game.\nTypes\nBurst hardpoints function like Repeater PDTs and come automatically installed on a ship when assembled. \nPulse hardpoints function similarly to Pulse PDTs. These spinals fire a pulse at a slow rate and a slower recharge, but a large amount of damage to the target if the beams can be focused.\nChaingun hardpoints function similarly to Chaingun PDTs. These have a high fire rate, and a x1.25 damage multiplier to hull, at a cost of a x0.65 damage multiplier to shield, a faster overheat time, and lower accuracy.\nDetonator hardpoints are installed on small miners. They fire a projectile that blasts off chunks of ore from asteroids which then can be collected via tractor beam.\nMining Laser hardpoints can be installed on small miners. They function identically to the mining turrets on medium and large miners such as the Ozark. It's generally advised to use detonators because lasers are generally less efficient, meaning they are only really useful for AFK mining.\nTurrets\nPrices\nBurst\n1000 C\nPulse\n1000 C\nChaingun\n1000 C\nDetnator\n(Needs Info)\nMining Laser\n(Needs Info)\nStats\n(Needs information)",
