This ship is preferable to pilots who enjoy a fast playstyle, yet do not want to become a complete glass cannon.\nDisadvantages\nDespite its defense rigs, a Lycentian ship and interceptor will still have poor hull. Ion weapons are deadly to this ship and any stasis slowing it more than it already is will heavily disadvantage it in dogfights.\nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\n- The current Triazo is modeled by ii_Cove.\nInterceptors\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nDefiance\nFalcon\nParagon\nHybrid Paragon\nValiance\nZenith\nPolaris\nHybrid Polaris\nMegalodon\nMackerel\nCandiru\nMandator\nParrot\nMacaw\nRighteous\nTetra\nTriazo\nRighteous Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nTetra\nLuster\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nDignity\nNobility\nT2\nTriazo\nLucent\nExotic",
