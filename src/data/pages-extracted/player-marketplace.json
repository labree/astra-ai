  "full_text": "Player Marketplace\nThe player marketplace is the buy-and-sell system that is controlled and used by players using the currency Credits. It allows players to list orders to sell or buy items from others for a certain amount of time and fee. Instead of players needing to use a vendor and staying online and active to sell items, the player market allows players to list their items so that they can be sold even when offline. The marketplace is connected in all servers in the same system. \nActive Markets\nAs of March 2024, there are 2 active marketplaces in the game, the most populous (and by far recommended marketplace) being The Citadel. The Mining Guild core system Quarry is, at the moment, the second most populated marketplace in the game, with players even resorting to Fargo's to make sure they sell something due to the massive influx of sell and buy orders. The Union Station marketplace in Harbor used to be fairly popular among traders, but with the Mining Guild becoming a thing, it has since been nearly deserted by many. Beyond that, you will be lucky to find a single order in any marketplace let alone a good deal.\nGetting Started\nThe marketplace can be accessed using a market terminal. This will bring up a menu with 3 tabs. Each will be listed and described below.\nBuy Tab\nThe buy tab allows players to buy items that were listed by other players. After purchasing an item, it will wait for the market to confirm and then it will be transferred to your storage. The marketplace will show the cheapest of that item on the market, minimizing the amount of credits spent on an item.\nYou give credits, you receive an item, based on what sell orders other players have created.\nSell Tab\nThe sell tab will allow you to sell items from your storage to your people who have buy orders set up. Starscape will automatically show the most expensive item that was listed which will maximize your profits from selling.\nYou give items, you receive credits, based on what buy orders other players have created.\nOrders Tab\nThe orders tab will allow you to list your own orders. All orders will have a duration on how long they will stay listed. After the order expires, it will be delisted from the marketplace and your items will be returned to your storage. Creating an order will also have a listing fee. Depending on your location will determine the fee, for example, The Citadel has a listing tax of 2.75%, though systems in the Trade Union, like Harbor, have lower listing prices.\nListing Buy Orders\nA created Buy Order will be listed in the Sell Tab. When creating a Buy Order, it will bring up a menu of all items in Starscape. After choosing which item you would like to buy, it will ask for how much you would like to buy the item and at and how many of them you want. You are limited by the amount of money you have. After placing the order, the market will take the money to pay for the buy order. If the buy order is canceled, the money will then be returned back to the player. \nCreating a buy order does not guarantee you an item. If you don't offer enough money, then players will not fulfill your orders with the items you want.\nListing Sell Orders\nUse these to sell your items. When selecting this order, it will bring up your assets where you may choose any item from there to sell, whether from Inventory or Storage. Just like the Buy orders, it will ask for how many of that item you would like to sell and at what cost. You are limited by the amount of the item you have.\nIf you ask for too much, of if another player undercuts your price by listing their copies of your item for less, than your items will not sell.\nExpediting Orders\nYou can choose to pay extra to avoid the delay that takes place before your order is visible to other players. Only do this if necessary, as it can be unneeded.",
