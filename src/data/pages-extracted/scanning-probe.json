  "full_text": "Scanning Probe\n \nProbes are deployables accessible from the ship menu. There are four types of probes: system, planet, interplanetary, and interstellar, and are used to scan for anomalies, aberrations, and players.\nUsage\nOpen the ship menu by pressing Z or Ctrl, then hold LMB on the type of probe you want to send out. Probes are one-time use. You can craft more probes from the Manufacturing section of an industrial station.\nSystem probes\nIf there are anomalies in the system, a map of the system will open with the number of planets and remaining anomalies at the bottom left. Guide the scanner probe with the mouse. It will beep more frequently the closer it gets to an anomaly. If the scanning probe is not close enough to any anomaly, it will maintain a constant beeping rate. The trail will also change color from cyan to red as the probe nears an anomaly.\nThe scanner probe will continue to operate until it runs out of fuel, which is represented by the number next to the scanner probe on the star system map. If the system map is closed, the scanner probe will continue to use fuel despite not moving. Once time runs out, the probe stops moving and leaves behind a white trail on the system map. \nYou may also scan planets for the presence of aberrations. If there are any, question marks will come out of the scanned planet, with most aberrations being on planets with rings. If instead of question marks, exclamation marks come out of the scanned planet, this signals the warp hub or ring of a planet containing hostile encounters.\nIf there are no more anomalies in a system, the probe will stop beeping but can still be controlled. You may still scan the planets for aberrations, or quit manually by clicking the red button on the bottom left of the system map to abandon it.\nPlanet/Interplanetary probes\nPlanet scanning probes are operated automatically with no input from the player besides its launch. The basic variety will scan the planet you are currently at, while the interplanetary version will open a dialogue box allowing you to scan any planet of your choice in the system. Only unvisited planets or planets with aberrations need to be scanned with this type of probe; first scan planets with a system probe or by visiting them to detect any aberrations. The interplanetary variation will report any encounters in the selected planet if you have not visited the planet yourself even if the planet does not have any aberrations.\nInterstellar probes\nThese probes can scan systems adjacent to your current system and will scan automatically. Upon launch, a dialogue box will open to select which system to scan. After a few seconds you'll receive a report detailing if anyone is in the system and how long ago they were there, as well as the number of planets and the chance of anomalies.\nTips\nOne of the most efficient ways to find anomalies is to draw a rectangle with the scanning probe centered around the middle of the system map, but other ways include Waveform Scanning, where you loop around the system in a zig-zag centered around the star(s) of a system.\nYou cannot find any more anomalies than the ones in a first scan, for the scanners only find the anomalies in the server's solar system.\nThe speed, detection radius and cooldown of probes can be improved considerably by the exploration skill tree.\nTrivia\nThere is always at least one wormhole in a system with six or more anomalies. This is because wormholes have 1 entrance and exit point in each system. If the exit point spawns in a system with the maximum of 5 anomalies, it will appeared to have exceeded it. Because of this, there could theoretically be an infinite number of anomalies in a single system.\nThe Next Gen update reworked probes to be free and infinite with a small cooldown between probes. This was reverted to the previous system (crafted, consumable probes) in a minor update on December 8, 2024.",
