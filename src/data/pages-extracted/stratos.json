However, it still has the necessary firepower to do low-level missions.\nTrivia\nThe current Stratos is modeled by swindle150.\nStarter ships other than the Stratos were planned to be released in the Next Generation update, but were scrapped due to time limitations. As such, the Stratos remains the only Scout-class ship.\nThe Stratos cannot be crafted or repackaged.\nThe Stratos is the only ship in Starscape where kills against it are recorded in every player's career.\nDespite being the weakest ship in just about every stat imaginable, many Strati can overwhelm and destroy much more powerful ships.\nFor a 2021 April Fools event, the Stratos' size was drastically increased to frigate proportions, and many were utilized against a few of the developers (who were in Sunfish class Foralkan cruisers, equipped with full Flak Cannon V) in an epic battle, resulting in the triumph of the Stratos. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9WWdPZzMck4\nAfter the Next Gen update, various players were able to destroy the Drone Battleship with the Stratos, utilizing long-range pulse hardpoints and the battleship's bugged aggro range to snipe it without retaliation.\nFighters\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nLegionis\nAurora\nLuminar\nHybrid Luminar\nStronghold\nSabre\nClaymore\nHybrid Claymore\nMegalodon\nPiranha\nThresher\nMandator\nToucan\nHornbill\nRighteous\nLuster\nLucent\nConstellation\nStratos\nConstellation Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nStratos\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nT2\nExotic",
