Emuz is the secure system counterpart to Eomclucloo in terms of Starscape memes and inside jokes.\nEdusfee\nUnsecure\nPirate Hotspot\nThe deepest unsecure system into wild space and has several good stations. Occasionally used as a resting place for bypassers and often does not see serious combat scenarios unfold.\nEmas\nUnsecure\nPirate Hotspot\nA popular pirating system on route between The Citadel and The Lycentian-Foralkan Front. Setting a route to Lycentia or The Syndicate from The Citadel with safe-route off will generally lead you through Emas.\nEod'taost\nUnsecure\nPirate Hotspot\nA popular system for pirates due to being a chokepoint into Syndicate territory. It also has only 1 planet making it easy to intercept players passing through.\nEomclucloo\nUnsecure\nLore\nEomclucloo is widely recognized by the Starscape community as arguably the most memed system during the game's early access phase. Being prominently used as the famous (within the community) \"Eomclucloo Planet 4\" GIF. As an inside joke about the 4th planet within its system being treated as a safe haven where pvp is illegal at it. (The original GIF can be found here:https://tenor.com/view/roblox-starscape-roblox-starscape-space-game-gif-18361114)\nGatinsir\nUnsecure\nPirate Hotspot\nThe closest unsecure system to The Citadel. It is the most popular hotspot for pirates and has also been home to Starscape's largest battles, including the Grand Battle of Gatinsir. Older players sometimes lure new players here to kill them.\nElase\nUnsecure\nPirate Hotspot\nThis system has become a popular pirating location due to its proximity to Quarry, the capital of the Mining Guild, and it being the most convenient way to reach the unsecure systems that yield the Tier 2 Mining Guild missions and above.\nMuex\nUnsecure\nHistorical\nFormerly a pirate hotspot, though pirate activity still exists in the system. Home to the biggest fighter battle that ever took place. Prior to the Getting Around update, it was the closest wild system to the Citadel. After the update, it was converted into an Unsecure System.\nMazae\nUnsecure\nHistorical\nConsidered the place where the first large player faction battle took place between SJ-C and TBB. Both sides inflicted heavy losses on each other. SJ-C ultimately emerged victorious.\nOmogast\nUnsecure\nName\nA formerly popular warzone on the Foralkan/Kavani front due to its name sounding similar to \"Among Us.\" It was converted to an Unsecure system in the Next Gen Update.\nSize\nUnsecure\nName\nAnother notable system mainly recognized for its name, and plenty of other systems had generated names that are real words like it. Such as Fire, Gates, Mode and Steak.\nStoyd Ydase\nUnsecure\nPirate Hotspot\nA popular system among player pirates, located between Trade Union territory and the Kavani-Foralkan warfront.\nUsib\nUnsecure\nHistorical\nA system that's recently gained fame for having a large flat platform of terrain where planet 6 should normally be. This could potentially be a teaser for planet landings in the future.\nAbjit\nContested\nHistorical\nAbjit is the location of one of the most expensive (in uninsured ship values) battles in Faction Warfare, known as the \"Abjit Massacre.\" It was a 20v20 Kavani player destroyers versus Lycentian player destroyers battle, resulting in 2 Kavani and 18 Lycentian deaths.\nAerelret\nContested\nPirate Hotspot\nA popular warzone on the Lycentian/Foralkan front. Formerly an unsecure system and second deadliest system to Gatinsir.\nArab\nContested\nName\nA popular warzone on the Lycentian/Kavani front, primarily for its name.\nEbas\nContested\nHistorical\nA contested system on the Lycenti-Kavani Front. Home to a huge battle shared by neighboring contested systems Beta Aract, Eduka, Ibliog and Kucid and nearby unsecure system Abil-ke, where a 30-man rally of Lycentian members, most of whom were piloting destroyers, were massacred by a swarm of fighters. This was one of the most catastrophic losses to the Lycentian playerbase resource-wise. Most of said ships were destroyed in this system.\nIolkog\nContested\nHistorical\nIolkog is known for being home to the first ever multiplayer PvE battle, or battle of any type, in Starscape history, back when it was Unsecure.\nShedletsky\nContested\nName\nOne of the very few manually named systems in the game, named after famous Roblox employee and figure John Shedletsky whom Keth worked with.\nTastae\nContested\nHistorical\nHome to the biggest single battle in Starscape's history without the servers shutting down over stressing player counts. Like Size, it is also instantly recognized for its name.\nZeluw Si\nContested\nHistorical\nHome to the largest player battle that never took place between the player factions Genesis and the Golden Accord when it used to be a Wild system. Referred to as the \"Great Shame\". Over 180 players were present and although there were some small skirmishes, the server would shut down before any massive combat activity could play out. It is now looked back upon today as a stepping stone in the potential of 200 player battles running stable on one server.\nBaszucki\nWild\nName\nAnother manually named system in Starscape. This system was named after David Baszucki, the co-founder and CEO of Roblox.\nCid Tapa\nWild\nPirate Hotspot\nClosest wild system to the Citadel after the Getting Around update, due to the addition of warp relays. Like Gatinsir, newer players are commonly lured here and the system is now one of the most popular pirate hotspots. Unlike Gatinsir, the \"Wild\" system status allows the use of the Warp Disruptor, and has no insurance, which can make the system especially dangerous.\nDelta Anca\nWild\nLore\nLeads to G-09, an uncharted system containing a destroyed planet, a destroyed stargate-like object and the shattered remains of an unknown fleet. An endless lightning storm is also present for added ambience. It was also the first of the nine gate systems to be discovered by DavidShark415/DavidNekO415. Read more at Gate Systems.\nNerel\nWild\nHistorical\nWas the system of choice for the Frigate Reveal Event and its massive battle.\nUrbis\nWild\nName\nAnother one of several systems in Starscape that were manually named. This one being named after the Roblox game Urbis that was formerly developed by ZolarKeth.\nVlasium\nWild\nHistorical\nA popular pirate hotspot. Notably the first wild system that was accessible by a single jump from Ves-ialk, a secure system within Foralkan territory.",
