  "full_text": "Syndicate\nThe Syndicate is the second mercantile NPC faction, along with the Trade Union and the Mining Guild. Syndicate freighters are often only found in Unsecure Systems or Wild space, as mentioned in their faction description. They CAN be found in contested systems, albeit rarely. All of their faction territory is situated in wild space, and all systems short of the core are unsecure. Syndicate territory is generally time-consuming to get to when compared with other factions, simply because it is relatively far from the core compared to other factions. To get to the Syndicate from the core, players must traverse contested and unsecure systems, making it much more likely they will encounter both NPC and player threats along the way, or be forced to turn back entirely.\nNot much is known about the Syndicate and their operations, but it is presumed that they operate an illegal black market and also have an interest in rare spices. This explains why they do not have a representative office in the Citadel and why they are mainly situated in wild and unsecure space, where there is no CoreSEC presence and acquiring such resources is much easier compared to the Core. It is also presumed that they prefer to stay away from combat, due to their investments into Lightburners, Signal Cloaks, and other modules that help decrease detection. Their Cloak Line ships also have a built-in signal cloak, further decreasing detection range and allowing them to slip in and out of systems unseen.\nStanding Items\nSee also: Standing Items\nStanding Items are the necessary bits of loot required to increase standing with each faction.

However, it is unknown if they attack drones or pirates due to the fact that they are only encountered in FO (Frontier Outposts) anomalies. Syndicate Freighter A.I. will attack only in self-defense. They can be found floating about in wild space and some unsecure systems (rarely in contested systems), and will move in a random direction quite slowly. Upon coming close, players can open a Menu to buy items from them - each freighter will have a random pool of decently rare items. If a freighter is hulled, it will slowly turn in a random direction and warp away. Destroying a Freighter will result in a decrease of 50 Standing Points with the Syndicate.",
