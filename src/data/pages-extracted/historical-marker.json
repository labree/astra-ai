  "full_text": "Historical Marker\nHistorical Markers were Markers placed around the galaxy, marking historical events. They were quietly removed some time in 2022 after the Next Gen Update, presumably at the same time as the removal of Wrecked Gate Structures. They were later re-added, but are documented here in case they are removed again.\nGrand Battle of Gatinsir\n \nFebruary 10, 2020\nGatinsir, Planet 1\nThe monument in the image can be found at Planet 1 of Gatinsir, floating in space not far from the space station. It reads: \n\"Gatinsir has been the host of countless battles. It is undoubtedly the bloodiest system in the galaxy. But while most engagements in Gatinsir are pirate affairs, from time-to-time it has been the site of larger faction engagements.\nTensions had been rising between Pegasus and SJ-C. The two factions declared war, and after a week of skirmishes a site was chosen for their final confrontation. The battle would come to be known as the Grand Battle of Gatinsir.\nAt the time, it was the largest and costliest battle in Starscape history. Much of its price tag was thanks to the inclusion of corvettes, which had just recently been made available to pilots. Over thirty players participated, and fifteen corvettes were lost during the engagement, putting estimated losses at around 1.3 million credits.\nAfter the battle, the two factions agreed to a truce and ended the war.\"\nThe Poison Ball Pit\nOctober 28, 2020\n \n \nHarbor\n\"Update 1.5 introduced the player marketplace. Because Trade Union systems had lower listing fees than anywhere else in the galaxy, players flooded Union Station to set up market orders.\"\n\"However, the player marketplace wasn't the only thing introduced in update 1.5; in addition, a bug was introduced which caused all poison grenades to never detonate and stick around indefinitely. \"\n\"Within hours, Union Station was overrun with a flood of grenade canisters. 2,780 grenades littered the station floor when the server was finally shut down.\n\"Though the bug which created the 'ball pit' of grenades was patched, it's memory lives on in this historical marker-- a testament to the immesurable and often ludicrous willpower of the Starscape community,\"\nIolkog\nDecember 20, 2018\nIolkog, Planet 1\nIolkog used to be host to two drone factories constructed around the second planet. Their close proximity to each other made them a very dangerous location, especially considering that pilots did not at this time have access to warships.\nA strike force of eight Star-Jumpers ambushed the factories in what was, at the time, the largest engagement in Starscape history. The human forces ultimately emerged victorious against the drones with no ships lost.\nSince then, the scale of battles in the galaxy has increased dramatically and engagements of this size are a common occurrence. This historical marker is a reminder to all of us that great things often have humble beginnings.\nBattle of Mazae\n \nJuly 22, 2019\nMazae, Planet 1\nThe Early days of group PVP engagements in Starscape were experimental. There was no clearly defined meta, and player groups had to figure out for themselves what worked best through trial and error.\nMazae was the site of one of these early engagements. SJ-C and ANF/TBB initiated the first large faction battle in the Starscape history. Around twenty people participated in the fight, which was also notable for being one of the first to make liberal use of warp disruptors. Ultimately, SJ-C forces emerged victorious.\n\"Battle\" of Zeluw Si\n \nMay 16, 2020\nZeluw Si, Planet 1\n \nThe monument can be found floating near a shipwreck graveyard. The monument has the appearence of a transparent marble with a red sphere in the middle of it, surrounded by multiple lined up triangles facing towards the sphere. It reads:\n''Engagements in Starscape continued to grow until they finally hit a ceiling. That ceiling was the battle of Zeluw Si, a battle between Genesis and the Golden Accord which never happened. It is still referred to by some as 'The Great Shame'.\nAfter reaching a player count of 180, the server died before any real action begun. While some skirmishes happened after the server restarts, the battle never happened the way it was intended.\nSome day, Zeluw Si will be looked back upon as an important stepping stone to stable 200-player engagements.''\nAnti-piracy Action at Nerel\n \n March 11, 2020 \n Nerel, Planet 1 \nThe Monument can be found floating near a mine and drone factory. It seems to be the remains of an abandoned pirate base. It reads:\n \n''Coresec had a problem on its hands: a freighter convoy had recently been ambushed by an unknown group of pirates. Top-secret blueprints had been stolen, and the pirates were using the blueprints to manufacture deadly new warships.\nWith its resources spread thin, Coresec turned to the galactic community for help. It authorized pilots to organize into anti-piracy forces, and offered the salvaged loot as reward to anyone who could take down the pirate fleet.\nHidden deep within wild space, the pirate fleet was eventually discovered by scouts and its position was made public to the galactic community. A group of nearly one hundred pilots converged on Nerel to take on the pirates. After a chaotic confrontation, the pirate fleet and its powerful frigates were destroyed.\nThis live event served as the reveal for the game's frigate designs.''",
