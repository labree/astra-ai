  "full_text": "Anti-Piracy\nAnti-Piracy is the act of attacking and destroying the ships of players who are pirates, either for loot, bounties, or ideological reasons.\nSome anti-pirates kill those who they believe to be pirates in order to take their inventory.\nPlayers who have been killed can place a bounty on their killer, and a portion of that bounty can be claimed when another player kills the killer, depending on the value and size of the ship destroyed. However, because there is no way to track a player with a bounty, \nMany professed anti-pirates simply disagree with the idea of pirating, and assemble into 'anti-pirate' factions.\nTips on How to Anti-Pirate\nPractice PvP with a group!\nThere are a lot more pirates than anti-pirates, and most pirates are significantly better at combat than anti-pirates.\nHow to Avoid Losing Your Favorite Ship\nUse a inexpensive ship that you know can kill certain Pirates: If your destroyer is at risk because they are more skilled, try using a Fightercraft or a Corvette with only tier 1 turrets and no modules as this is a way of avoiding losing modules and stronger turrets, and it can help you practice real combat when you are attempting to anti-pirating, soon, you will be able to use a Destroyer or a Frigate confidently enough to defeat. Note that: Many pirates will change strategies and use backup ships. For example, you defeated their Conciliator, they might use Loxodon or the same ship you have, or even worse, use Fortitude to snip you. However, the good news is, if they are sniping you, they cannot disrupt you, so use this to warp away as fast as you can to a different system like to a secure system and your Destroyer will be saved. If its a Loxodon or ships that they are using with rapid fire, dock if its a shield tank and if its a hull tank, use a lightburner to avoid the maximum damage and warp away. However, if they have a lightburner and came to you, hope that they did not disrupt you before warping. If they did disrupt you, try fighting back and avoid combat logging as it increases the risk of losing your ship and hope that you do not die when in combat.",
