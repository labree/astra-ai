  "full_text": "Mining Turrets are small (S) turrets which can be equipped on ships with S-turret slots, such as corvettes, frigates, and destroyers. These turrets deal no damage to ships, neither when fired at them or flown through by them, and cannot be used for combat. \nMining turrets cannot be equipped to small miners like Marlin or Badger. Those ships have their own built-in mining lasers.\n\nWhen fired they project a small laser, which turns either red or green depending on whether an asteroid is detected. If an asteroid is detected, then they will fire a mining beam, which varies in color depending on the turret type, and will begin to mine the asteroid until the asteroid is depleted or until the player makes them stop. \nAs it mines, a portion of the ore will be automatically sucked through the beam to your inventory, and a portion of it will break off of the asteroid and need to be tractored in manually through the use of Tractor PDTs.\n \n\nThere are many types of mining turrets that have been created, with varying levels of performance and speed. The basic mining turret has two tiers, at which point it branches into 3 separate lines with different focuses. \n\nTier\nT1\nT2\nOre per\nminute \n3.4\n3.7\nCapture Ratio\n65%\nIce yield\n50%\nMining turrets use a powerful excavator beam to break off ore from asteroids.

It is significantly better at mining ice and is a lot faster at doing so. Because of its lower mining power at non-ice ores, it is not as popular.
