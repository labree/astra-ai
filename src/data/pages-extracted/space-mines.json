It can be activated by opening the probe menu - through the Ctrl or Z key - and deploying it. Once deployed, space mines serve as passive obstacles, damaging any ship that flies within its area of effect. They will also explode upon being shot at or another space mine exploding in their vicinity.\nPlayers can only deploy mines in Wild systems. However, mines can be found naturally occurring in minefields (found in all systems besides core ones), where large amounts of them may make traversing the area extremely hazardous.\nCost\nSpace mines can be bought for 120 credits each in the NPC marketplace. Alternatively, players can craft them with 15 Korrelite, 10 Reknite and 1 Gellium at a Manufacturing terminal.\nStats\nStats\nCooldown\n10s\nRange\n150\nRadius\n450\nDamage\n60",
