  "full_text": "Spice\nSpice is a type of item that can be transported with haulers. They are obtained from Spice Platforms, Wrecked Spice Platform Anomalies, and Frontier Outposts. After taking on cargo, you can no longer enter space stations until you sell them, store them in a station's cargo dock, or eject them.\nYou can make credits by acquiring spices where the price is low (or free) and selling them where the price is high. \nSpices come in 13 different colors, each with differing rarity. Every non-wild system has a specific spice color, which can be seen by selecting the \"Spice Color\" filter in the map interface. The primary spice colors are Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Red, and Yellow. The rare variants of these spices (known as gemstone spices), found exclusively in Frontier Outposts and SP anomalies, are Sapphire, Jade, Jasper, Amethyst, Ruby, and Amber respectively. Silver Spice can only be found in Syndicate territory.\nColor\nSpice Location\nBlue/Sapphire\nBetween The Syndicate and CoreSec's territory, some found at the western border of the Lycentian Federation.\nGreen/Jade\nMostly found in Lycentian Territory, some found between CoreSec and Lycentian Federation's southwestern border.\nOrange/Jasper\nFound in the Sentinel Region in the Lycentian Federation and in between the northern border of the Foralkan Star Empire and Lycentian Federation's southern border.\nPurple/Amethyst\nMostly found within the Foralkan Empire and its western borders.\nRed/Ruby\nSouth of the Kavani Mandate and in between them and the Trade Union.\nYellow/Amber\nMostly found in the Kavani Mandate, but can be purchased from the systems in its eastern and western borders.\nSilver\nExclusively found in Syndicate territory.\nSpice Profitability Chart\nThe chart below shows which spice regions to haul between to make the most profit.\nChart key:\nRed: No or loss of profit\nOrange: Little profit\nYellow: Decent profit\nGreen: Great profit.\nNote that the sell and buy price of spice also makes a difference. Even if you buy purple spice and sell it in blue spice zones, if the buy price was greater than the sell price you will lose money. Prices of spice will increase over time as you buy more, and will sell for less as you sell more. (This means that you should switch color combinations once in a while)\nSpice Profit Chart\nDamaged Spices\nDamaged Spices are a variant of Spices that cannot be sold at a station's cargo bay (unlike normal spices), and can only be sold at commercial or other stations that have a market terminal. they sell at a flat rate, with normal spices selling at 180 and rarer spices at 300 each. Unlike regular Spice, which are a cargo item (requiring cargo slots), Damage Space are inventory items and thus, do not require cargo slots to be collected.\nDamaged Spice can be obtained by shooting dropped Spice Crates, either ejected by a player or found in SP Anomalies. Shooting the crates will turn them into normal loot containers, from where the Damage Spice can be acquired.\nDamaged Spice are more convenient than regular Spice, due to their lack of cargo requirement. However, they will fetch less credit than properly hauled Spice. It is worth noting that regular Spice sold to a space station at the worst possible rate is still more valuable than damaged spice.",
