The current range of Faction standing goes from -2000 to 5000 standing points.\nObtaining\nFaction Standing points can be gained by doing Missions for a specific faction of choice, with the reward depending on the tier. They can also be obtained by turning in specific items formerly owned by an opposing group that increase standing with that faction (as an example, a Kavani mission log can be turned over to either the Lycentians or the Foralkans for extra standing points). CoreSec's enemy is Drones, and Syndicate and Trade Union are enemies to NPC Pirates.

There, Go to the office of the faction you wish to fix standing with and tell the ambassador that you want to fix your standing. The Ambassador will offer you a pardon in the case you pay reparations to the origin's treasury or reserves, paid at a rate of 5 credits per Standing point. Once paid, the ambassador will have another dialogue popup over them \"finalizing your pardon\". Once paid, the ambassador greets you with the dialogue used for tier 0 players. Players can also turn in items for Standing to increase their standing manually. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO RESET YOUR STANDING WITH CORESEC WITHOUT THE USE OF STANDING ITEMS (please note, you will be unable to enter the Citadel if you have -500 standing with CoreSec).\nTrivia\n- Upon reaching Hero status with all factions, you will be granted the \"Galactic Hero\" title\n- Inversely, reaching Enemy status with all factions grants you the \"Enemy of the Galaxy\" title. This title is a good bit rarer than Galactic Hero as it takes a lot more effort to get- particularly because of the difficulty of killing CoreSec ships, and the difficulty of finding enough Trade Union and Syndicate freighters to destroy.",
