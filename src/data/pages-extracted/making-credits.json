  "full_text": "Making Credits\nMaking credits is essentially the point of the whole game. With them, you can buy ships, upgrades, weapons, and armor, as well as other items. There are a ton of ways to earn credits. listed below.\nMissions\n \nFactions provide quests that provide credits on completion. These quests vary from assaulting an enemy base to resupplying outposts to retrieving intelligence reports from spies. Missions are one of the most easily-understood ways of making credits, and are an attractive option for newer players because you don't need any credits to start one. Missions also have the added bonuses of increasing your Standing and Loyalty Points with the faction who gives it.\nSee Missions for further information.\nMining\n \nMining asteroids is another one of the simplest and most consistent ways of making credits in Starscape, since it is heavily focused on in the tutorial.\nWhile mining can be done in any ship with weapons, ships with dedicated mining weapons are much faster - it's recommended for new players to start by using an Badger. While NPCs will buy any materials mined for a minimal price, materials are needed to build all later game ships or upgrade, so they can always be sold for more to other players (usually at the Citadel market).\nMining in Core and Secure systems is safe, for the most part, but only low quality, common ores will spawn. Mining is much more profitable when done in Unsecure and Wild systems, though this is more dangerous due to the presence of Pirates and Drones, and the ever-present threat of a hostile player appearing. The best method for mining in wild space is to fly to a distant area and use Scanning Probes to find asteroid Anomalies, as rarer ores can be found there and there are no NPC enemies to worry about. \nFor advanced mining techniques that involve multiple Roblox accounts, see Multiboxing. \nHauling\n \nWhile hauling is not very effective early on, since newer player do not have the massive freighters available late-game, it can be very profitable when done correctly. Players can haul spice, supplies, and mission items. \nMission items are hauled to destinations specified by the mission agent. Spice is purchased from spice platforms or Frontier Outposts and then sold across the galaxy for maximum profit.\nMilitary Faction supplies are picked up from faction Staging Areas and delivered to Contested System HQ stations for credits and Loyalty Points/Standing. Mercantile Faction supplies are purchased from the mercantile faction's capital and then sold to any Contested HQ station for high profit.\nPurchasing spices from a spice station or FO will cause the price to go up, and selling spices to a station will cause the price to go down - this means that repeatedly using the same spice route (or using common spice routes) will slowly make it less profitable.\nWH/FO Spice Hauling\nA notable form of spice hauling is Wormhole/Frontier Outpost hauling, or WH/FO hauling for short, which involves finding a wormhole that leads to wild space, and then finding a Frontier Outpost nearby.\nUsing the wormhole allows you to skip the vast majority of the time spent hauling, and make exceptionally profitable gemstone spice trades in just a few warps. Using a large ship, these routes can be usually be \"exhausted\" (by raising the FO prices high enough that the trip isn't worth it) in around half an hour to an hour, making well over 100k credits in the process. This makes it by far the most effective means of earning credits, though only if you can find a suitable wormhole.\n \n Trading\nTrading with players is a viable method of making credits, as there are many players that require materials but are unable to find them. It should be used in conjunction with mining in order to get cheaper ores, alongside allowing one to sell ores at a higher price than what the Citadel offers, especially for Axnit, Narcor, and Red Narcor, which often sell for a decent price per piece. \n Piracy\nThere are two ways of reliably getting money, namely selling/refining scrap and whatever is in their cargo. Generally the former is very reliable when compared to the latter, although the latter can easily net someone enough resources for even entire warships. \nYou can pirate by using a combat ship and destroying ships that warp into an unsecure or wild system to stop people from simply warping out of there just launch a warp disruptor, or use the disruptor ability. It works best on miners or haulers as they have little ability to fight back.\nYou may also want to ransom a player. While generally a bad choice if they are armed and have something like beams, due to the loss of cargo on player death, getting a good ransom can easily give you great profit. Demanding credits can be even better, especially against haulers who don't usually carry valuable items but usually have a large supply of credits from spice trading.\n Drone Hunting/ Drone Fleets\nDrone hunting is easy to pick up even in a Stratos, but the further out from the Core you go, the stronger and faster the drones become, and more types of drones can spawn. For a starter, a mid tier Fighter or Interceptor are good ships to hunt drones, as ships that tier boast decent mobility, and damage output. Drone drops vary from Junk, to high level Ship Upgrades. This makes profiting semi-luck based, but higher level enemies in Unsecure and Wild systems most commonly drop better goods and more of them. Alongside this a tier one ship upgrade nets similar profits to a tier zero mission. Alongside this, the Destroy: Drones mission can be taken, which will be completed by killing specific classes of drones.\nAs you get a better combat ship you will be able to take on more and more drones, and eventually Drone Fleets. You will know it is a drone fleet if there are 2-5 circles with ship icons on the top of your screen. You will also be able to check your progress this way. Drone fleets can be found in secure, unsecure, and wild systems, although the biggest and most lucrative fleets only spawn in wild systems. Drone fleets can be taken out by a single person, depending on your flying skills, what ship you have, and how many times you leave and go heal your hull/shield, although it is MUCH easier when you have a team. There can be anywhere from 2-5 drone waves in a fleet, the difficulty of the ships, the number of waves, and the number of Drones all depend on what type of system you are in. All of these types of leaders have the chance to drop tier 4-5 upgrades, rare ores, command cores, turret blueprints, and warmods, though it is more common with the bigger leaders commander/ captain. Drone Commanders ONLY spawn on the last wave of a drone fleet. They can be distinguished by being white with blue highlights. Drone squad Leaders will be in interceptors, Lieutenants will be in fighter/corvette form, Commanders will be frigates, and Captains will be destroyers. NOTE: the Drone Captains are VERY strong. I would not recommend taking them on unless you are in a frigate, are very experienced, or are in a squad. 2-3wave fleets spawn in secure systems, 3-4 wave fleets spawn in unsecure systems, and wave 4-5 fleets spawn in wild systems. Killing fleets In wild systems can be extremely lucrative, not only do you get drone cores (which you can either sell or turn in for Coresec standing), you can also get a large amount of tier 1- 5 upgrades and warmods, rare materials such as axnit, narcor, or red narcor, as well as a good chance of getting high tier items by killing elite frigates, destroyers, or cruisers (Wild systems most commonly, but can be found in unsecure). When fighting 5 wave drone fleets, after destroying the commanding drone there is a small chance that a Drone Battleship might spawn in. When this happens all remaining drones that were left from the fifth wave will warp away and alarms will play with a note saying Scanner Warning: A high-energy signature is closing on your location followed by a small circle in place of the Drone fleet progress saying Destroy the Battleship. It is recommended to take on the Battleship with a group of at least nine or more players in frigates with experience, otherwise warp away at the moment you see the scanner warning to avoid being destroyed. When the Drone Battleship is destroyed it will drop multiple loot spots with very good loot from high tier ship upgrades, blueprints (not faction blueprints), ores, and junk.\nThere are theories in the community about the existence of Drone Admirals, Command-class cruisers, but these have yet to be proven, and it is unknown what conditions would cause them to spawn.\nScavenging\nThe least consistent, and arguably worst way of collecting credits, Scavenging is simply traveling from system to system, exploring wreckages, and BF anomalies for any items of use. You can find ship mods, guns, armor, and other items that can be sold to players through the marketplace. If done with a warship you can drone hunt as well. Similar to mining, loot obtained by scavenging gets better in systems farther away from the core with a more dangerous security status.\nKeep in mind that you will mostly find low level loot, e.g. tier 1 ship mods, rifles, etc, which typically sells for a few hundred credits. As a result, this is only recommended for new players.\nBounty Hunting\nIf a player is killed by another player, they may place a Bounty on the attacker. Anyone who kills the attacker will gain a portion of the Bounty equal to the worth of the ship they destroyed. Gaining credits this way is unreliable due to how large the map is and the possibility of the attacker having a stronger ship.\nFor more information on Bounty Hunting, click here.\nX-structure hunting\nThere is a very small chance that an X-aberration is a satelitte structure, which contains an ancient beacon. These contains a clue that leads to the location of an intact X-structure, which contains high level loot and lots of resources. If the player wishes to, however, they can sell these on the player market for 100k-130k.\nFor more information on X-structure hunting, check out the X-structure hunting page.\nStanding Rewards selling\nStanding Rewards can be purchased from faction terminals. You can find the terminals at stations in the faction's territories or in a HQ. It's a fast way to earn credits if you have lots of standing points from missions or protecting contested system and turning in special items. For example: you complete a mission for core sec for 100 standing points , you can buy 4 holograms that cost 25 points and can sell for 500 credits , 4 times 500 = 2k credits with the credits you get from the mission in the first place. But you can sell for even more if you use your points to buy blueprints that can be sold to the player market for a higher price.",
