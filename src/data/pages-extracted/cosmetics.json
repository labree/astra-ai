There are also Ethereal Skins, which are special event skins. Although they are put in the same Skin slot as all the other skins and change the color and texture of your ship, they function completely differently. They are ship-specific; an Ethereal Stratos skin cannot be applied to a Barracuda. They are kept and stored as items. They can be traded, dropped, and listed on the player market. They can only be applied to one ship, and they are destroyed when removed.\nNote about the Zero Alpha skin: It can fade between colours.\nBecause they were a limited-time event item, dropped by Ethereal Pirates, many ships in existence today were not present back then. Thus, those ships did not have Ethereal Skins. These include: \nAll Destroyers and the Yukon.\nThe Koronis Line\nThe Nebula Line\nThe Cloak Line\nThe Valiance Line warships\nAll Faction Interceptors except the Parrot\nAll Faction Fighters except the Luster and Thresher.\nAdditionally, Hybrid ships did not get their own Ethereal Skins. Instead, the skin of the base ship can be applied to them. For example, an Ethereal Polaris skin could be applied to a Hybrid Polaris.\nLasers\nThis customizes the lasers firing color.\nName\nTier\nObtained by\nDescription\nCandy Corn\n3\nThis aesthetic was available for purchase during Halloween 2020.\nA decorative laser that can be applied to a ship to modify its appearance.

There are also Ethereal Skins, which are special event skins. Although they are put in the same Skin slot as all the other skins and change the color and texture of your ship, they function completely differently. They are ship-specific; an Ethereal Stratos skin cannot be applied to a Barracuda. They are kept and stored as items. They can be traded, dropped, and listed on the player market. They can only be applied to one ship, and they are destroyed when removed.\nNote about the Zero Alpha skin: It can fade between colours.\nBecause they were a limited-time event item, dropped by Ethereal Pirates, many ships in existence today were not present back then. Thus, those ships did not have Ethereal Skins. These include: \nAll Destroyers and the Yukon.\nThe Koronis Line\nThe Nebula Line\nThe Cloak Line\nThe Valiance Line warships\nAll Faction Interceptors except the Parrot\nAll Faction Fighters except the Luster and Thresher.\nAdditionally, Hybrid ships did not get their own Ethereal Skins. Instead, the skin of the base ship can be applied to them. For example, an Ethereal Polaris skin could be applied to a Hybrid Polaris."
