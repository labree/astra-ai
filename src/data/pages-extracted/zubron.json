  "full_text": "Zubron\n\"The Zubron is a large hauling vessel. Unlike its smaller unarmed counterparts, it is able to defend itself through the use of two turret hardpoints.\"\nThe Zubron is a hauler-class ship of the Mastodon line. It is best suited as a pilot's first warship hauler.\nAdvantages\nThe Zubron features turret hardpoints and more PDT slots than the fighter-style haulers, and double the capacity and durability. On paper, it is much more efficient than the fighter-style haulers, and can make much more money, without requiring a blueprint or as much material as faction ships such as the Shroud or Galaxy. The Zubron can also stand toe-to-toe against the Astero (The Trade Union corvette-class hauler), with equal cargo capacity and better mobility.\nDisadvantages\nThe Zubron is outclassed by Frigate class haulers, and is a juicy target for pirates. As a warship, losing it will hurt much more and pilots should ensure their safety with escorts or subsystems that keep them alive in the face of threats such as players with disruptors and hostile NPCs.\nTrivia\n- The current Zubron is modeled by ii_Cove.\nHaulers\nLine\nT1\nT2\nT3\nCorvette\nFrigate\nNebula\nAstero\nGalaxy\nMastodon\nHyrax\nRhino\nBison\nZubron\nCloak\nVeil\nShroud",
