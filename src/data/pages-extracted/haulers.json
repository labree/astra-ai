  "summary": "Haulers are industrial ships that come in a variety of sizes, but share the same focus on carrying bulk amounts of items. They can host a large amount of cargo crates used to transport spice, supplies, and mission items, or simply large player items like disruptor bubbles or ships. However, they are far worse at defending themselves and fending off pirates or other combat ships of the same size.",
