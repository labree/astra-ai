  "full_text": "Halo\n\"The Halo frigate, named for the iconic ring of its midsection, utilizes a lightweight construction that makes it significantly faster than other frigates.\"\nThe Halo is a frigate-class ship of the Constellation ship line. It is best suited as a fast exploration ship due to its rigs and speed.\nAdvantages\nThe Halo is good at exploration due to its engine rigs, allowing it to warp around quickly and deal with threats from afar. As a frigate with several PDTs, it is reasonably efficient at NPC hunting as well, with main turrets dealing with large threats while its PDTs deal with small fightercraft.\nDisadvantages\nThe Halo, much like the rest of the Constellation line, is fragile, and if caught, will be killed quickly. While it can be used as a long-range kiting ship, it is outclassed by the Adamant. Fighters can chase this ship down despite its engine rigs if a pilot is not careful. Its healthpool is closer to the health of a corvette.\nTrivia\n- The current Halo is modeled by Infranium157 and Jeff_D.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nConstellation Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nStratos\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nT2\nExotic",
