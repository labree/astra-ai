  "full_text": "Warpable Objects\nPlanets\nPlanets can be found in every system, and every planet (except for those in Uncharted Gate Systems) can be warped to without scanning or probing. They are the hubs when you warp into the system, and will always be the same planet you will warp into if you're warping from the same system. This could lead to system camping, where pirates could attack you as soon as you warp in as they predict what planet you will warp to. Planets could be filled with stations, asteroid fields, spice platforms, graveyards, and minefields.\nRings\nRings are found at planets that could be warped into with lightcruise, using 10% of your energy and could be seen orbiting around a planet like a ring. (Hence the ring name) Inside rings, there could be asteroids and soon ice inside the rings that players could mine. Rings can also have aberrations, like deposits, which can have more high quality ores, or rarely X-Structures, which store rare and common loot only found in more dangerous systems. Aberrations can only be warped into with a planet probe scanning the ring.\nAnomalies\nAnomalies are areas that stay hidden until scanned by a system probe, and could have items like loot, resources, drones, or others. See the page \"Anomalies\" for more information.\nMissions\nMissions are areas you can warping if you currently have an active mission. Missions may vary depending on what the player choose. These can be found with a yellow \"!\" in space.\nAberrations\nAberrations are things you can find orbiting planets. They can either be an X-Structure or a deposit. You can find these by warping to a planet and using a planetary probe.",
