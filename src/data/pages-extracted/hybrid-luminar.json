  "full_text": "Hybrid Luminar\n\"The Hybrid Luminar is a technological marvel, combining human engineering with advanced drone technology to create a fighter with unparalleled shielding.\"\nThe Hybrid Luminar is a fighter-class ship of the Legionis ship line. It is an advanced sidegrade to the Luminar with generally improved statistics in every field outside of shield protection, and is best suited as a well-rounded PVE or transport fighter.\nAdvantages\nThe Hybrid Luminar has increased agility, slightly faster speed, energy regeneration and slightly higher damage output than the standard Luminar.\nThe Hybrid Luminar carries an Engine Module Slot, whereas the standard Luminar does not. Which can further enhance its speed.\nIt ties with the Lucent for having the highest deflection rating of all fighters and interceptors.\nDisadvantages\nThe Hybrid Luminar has 450 shield points compared to its predecessor which has 500. Hurting its overall durability despite the increased deflection rating.\nDue to requiring Vexnium and a rare blueprint to produce, it is difficult and expensive to obtain, and may prove too much of a liability rather than an asset for some players.\nTrivia\nThe current Hybrid Luminar is modeled by Jeff_D.\nBefore the Next Gen update, the Hybrid Luminar was called the Luminar-X, similar to the other 3 Hybrid ships.\nFighters\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nLegionis\nAurora\nLuminar\nHybrid Luminar\nStronghold\nSabre\nClaymore\nHybrid Claymore\nMegalodon\nPiranha\nThresher\nMandator\nToucan\nHornbill\nRighteous\nLuster\nLucent\nConstellation\nStratos\nLegionis Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nAurora\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nT2\nLuminar\nExotic\nHybrid Luminar",
