  "full_text": "Security Class\nThe security class of systems governs the rarity of loot found there, as well as the danger present. There are currently five security status types in the game.\nCore\nCore systems are the most peaceful types of systems in the game, with no PvP (except duels). It is a safe area with many players and trades are often in the system. There can be multiple servers of the same core system. There can be a maximum limit of 30 players in Core Systems. These systems serve as the capital of a nation or a staging area. CoreSec peacekeepers can be found with the 6 surrounding systems of the Citadel. You can still be attacked by NPCs if you have -1500 standing with that corresponding faction. \nSecure\nThese systems begin to show the unforgiving world of Starscape. While PvP (excluding duels) is also disabled here, 2-3 wave drone fleets, Small-Medium pirate dens, and light drone ships may spawn and pose a threat to the player. The events that happen above are rare, but it can be encountered. Many newer players mine here to begin their journey and get stronger ships. CoreSec monitors here although their ships are never seen in secure space.\nContested\nIn between the warring factions, contested space is dynamic and can change authority in a matter of days. These systems are controlled by at least one of the NPC factions and have NPC ships patrolling it. Similar to Unsecure Systems, it can have drone factories, 4 wave drone fleets, and large pirate dens. These may be captured by players if they are enlisted in a military with the 3 warring NPC factions. These systems have the same drop rates as Unsecure Systems, but they are much safer as warp disruption is disabled. See Faction Warfare for more information. \nUnsecure\nUnsecure Systems are systems that, similar to Contested Systems, have PvP enabled, except for duels. Loot tables for these systems are similar to loot tables found in Contested Systems.\nCertain modules that otherwise cannot be used in combat are enabled in Unsecure and Wild systems as well, most well-known being the warp disruptor module. As mentioned in the CoreSec notice when attempting to warp to these systems, piracy is much more common and dangerous, with stronger enemies being present in general, such as medium to large pirate dens, drone factories, tier 4 drone fleets, and advanced or elite drones, usually up to advanced destroyers and elite frigates. \nWhile the player-based danger is higher in the inner unsecure systems, similar to wild space, the threat usually switches to the environment itself the further the player goes out, as traffic becomes less and less dense, with most usually only accessing the systems for transit to another system.\nWild\nWild systems, or wild space, are portions of the galaxy found near the edges of the territories of the 3 main NPC factions, which have no stations or known human structures whatsoever, except for Frontier Outposts and the occasianal Destroyed spice outpost.\nThese systems, as mentioned by the CoreSec notice when attempting to warp to them, pose the highest danger to players in-game. Piracy occurs often in these systems, with a high danger to the player from both player-based and environmental sources. Usually, however, the deeper a player goes out into wild space, past the first few rings of systems, one may never encounter another player. \nPvP is enabled, with all modules/subsystems and deployable items usable in these systems. The main PVE threats found are usually drones and pirates, drones up to T5 fleets and megacomplexes, and pirates up to large dens.\nLoot quality is considered to be the highest in the game, with the rarest ores being naturally found here, such as Red Narcor and Vexnium, Vexnium coming from a dedicated anomaly or aberration and Red Narcor coming from other, more general anomalies. High amounts of high-quality basic ores can also be found here. X-Structures may be found here, usually containing higher quality loot and possibly ancient-quality items or even an Ancient Beacon.\nUncharted\nNote: This is not an official system class. Rather, it is a special variant of the wild system. Future updates may change the mechanics surrounding uncharted systems.\nUncharted systems, also referred to as Gate Systems, are a unique and rare system 'class', with only nine currently present in the galaxy, named G-01- G-09, respectively. These systems are invisible on the map unless the player is in an adjacent system or within these systems. The nine current uncharted systems each contain one massive ancient structure orbiting a neutron star, with system ambience being dark and moody. If you die or kill here, the kill log reads the system as ???. These systems currently do not serve any practical purpose within the game.\nTrivia\nA previously planned system class called \"Policed\" systems would have been an in-between for secure and unsecure systems, having PvP enabled but also having police NPCs spawning anytime a player is attacked.\nUncharted systems are supposedly planned to also include “uncharted wormhole systems” in the Starscape Roadmap page, which may refer to wormholes possibly leading to a system that is not part of the map by default.",
