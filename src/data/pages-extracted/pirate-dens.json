  "full_text": "Pirate Dens\nPirate dens are structures guarded by numerous NPC Pirates. They can spawn in all non-Core systems, in Warp Hubs or Rings. They resemble a group of round gray asteroids connected by metal trusses, and with various objects sticking out. \nPirate Dens are made up of three different types of structures: Shield Generators, Power Regulators, and the main Pirate Den. The Shield Generators must be destroyed in order to damage the Power Regulators, and the Power Regulators must be destroyed in order to damage the main Pirate Den. \nA wave of pirates will warp in upon the destruction of a Shield Generator or Power Regulator, and additional waves will warp in over time. \nPirate Dens drop materials, Warp Disruptors, Trade Union and Syndicate Standing Items, credits, and Dread modules and Ship blueprints. The loot drop is not really consistent, and you might end up getting poor or mediocre loot from even Large dens, however the recent Getting Around update may have improved the loot drops. It is still recommended to destroy the ships as the ships have been known to drop Dread tier loot. \nTypes of Den\nThere are three sizes of Pirate Den: Small, Medium, and Large. While the individual parts remain the same size, there are more of them depending on the size of the den. Additionally, larger dens summon more reinforcements and generally have better loot. \nSmall Pirate Den\nSmall pirate dens have 1 Power Regulator and 1 Shield Generator. They can drop Trade Union and Syndicate standing items, materials, T1 warp disruptors, credits, and rarely Dread items. Small dens can call in fighter and corvette reinforcements.\nThey can spawn in Secure, Unsecure, or Contested systems, and they can spawn Steeled Corvettes and Fighters.\nMedium Pirate Den\nMedium Pirate Dens have 2 Shield Generators and 2 Power Regulators. They can drop corvette blueprints, Trade Union and Syndicate standing items, T2 warp disruptors, materials, credits, and occasionally Dread items. They can call in fighter, corvettes and frigate reinforcements. Also, watch the amount of fighters, because if there are too many, they can mow down a frigate easily.\nThey can spawn in all non-Core systems and can spawn Pirates up to Dread Frigates.\nLarge Pirate Den\nLarge Pirate dens have 3 (sometimes 4) Shield Generators and 3 Power Regulators. They can drop Dread items, Trade Union and Syndicate standing items, frigate blueprints, materials, T3 warp disruptors, and credits.\nThey can spawn in Unsecure, Contested, or Wild systems, and they spawn many Dread and Steeled Destroyers. They are very, very dangerous.\nTips\nDon’t underestimate Large Pirate Dens. Many solo destroyers have been killed by large pirate dens due to underestimating their power. Don’t be afraid to kite and rest at another warp point if you need to. Furthermore, unless you’re an extremely skilled pilot, don’t bother taking them with frigates; Large Dens are sometimes challenging even going solo in a destroyer, so don’t risk your frigate. Some skilled pilots have taken on large pirate dens solo. Hull or shield tanking ships like the Justice, Bulwark, and Echelon, tech ships like the Conciliator, or high DPS ships like the Loxodon may be able to go solo on these dens.\nBlasters are best for fighting Pirate Dens. These are able to abuse the shields and melt hulls.\nIf you are fighting solo, it's often better to focus the Dread Frigates first over any non-Dread Destroyers. The destroyers are slow and typically hang close to the nest itself - frigates are much more aggressive however, and can deal a lot of damage if you're not prepared.\nIt is possible to cheese the reinforcement fleet by logging (either through safelog or leaving the system and re-entering), as the game saves the status of the structure (e.g., destroyed parts) but not the reinforcement fleets spawned from their destruction.\nIf you have railguns and are willing to wait, it’s possible to use the extended range of railguns to cheese the den by evading detection by the pirates and simply railing the structure to death. This might take a while, though.\nIf you're in any kind of industrial ship, it's in your best interest to warp away just as soon as humanly possible.\nWhen doing Contested supply hauling, be wary that it's not unheard of for a Large Den to spawn right at the planet you need to deliver to. The pirates in this case will typically be distracted with fighting the occupying force, but you may still want to avoid these if you've got a slow and fragile ship.\nThere is no guarantee for good loot, so do destroy all the Dread tier pirates. They can drop Dread loot and/or high amounts of credits.\nGallery\n",
