  "full_text": "Map\nStarscape is an enormous game consisting of 4576 charted systems. Each of these may include planets orbiting their stars in real time, different types of stations, alongside anomalies and aberrations which regularly spawn and despawn.\nThe Galactic Map\nThe Galactic Map can be brought up in the game by pressing the M key. Regional maps also appear in contested system HQs as physical tables.\nFor individual systems important to the game and its history, see Notable Systems. \nAn interactive map can be found here.\nThe map is often considered as divided into three main areas, which are further split into regions and subregions.\nInner Core, where CoreSec and the Trade Union are located, is comprised mostly of Secure and Core systems. It is often the region with the most player activity, because of the relative safety, and because they contain The Citadel and Harbor, the two most active markets in the game (as well as The Citadel being the default spawn point for new players). Due to the high activity levels, however, Unsecure systems in this region tend to be far more dangerous than Unsecure systems in other regions, since player pirates are aware of how many new players wander this region.\nFaction Space surrounds the core and is where the three main military factions reside: Lycentia, Kavani, and Foralkus. This is the only region where Contested systems exist (which comprise roughly half of the systems in this area), meaning this is the area where all Faction Warfare takes place. Players are commonly seen in the capital systems, but otherwise player activity is infrequent, unless there is a battle occurring (which is shown as a red target symbol on the map). Despite the low population density, many players spend a majority of their time here, doing missions and fighting wars, and only travelling to the Core to buy and sell specific goods.\nWild Space, as the name implies, is exclusively Wild systems. With the exception of the Syndicate and the Mining Guild, it is a lawless region with no governmental regulation. Because of the vastness of wild space, it is very uncommon to find other players here, especially further from the core. As one moves further away from the core, the main threat to developing players shifts from other players to enemy NPCs, which spawn in the great numbers and are far more powerful than the ones typically seen in non-wild systems. However, pro players have little trouble navigating these sectors, and spend a lot of time Drone Hunting and Pirate Hunting for powerful Hybrid and Dread loot. Because of just how many systems this area contains, it's very common for wormholes to lead deep into this region.\nThe System Map\nThe star system map can be accessed at any time by pressing \"N.\" It shows a map of your current system with Celestial Objects and the structures orbiting them marked.\nThe “Echoes of the Past” update completely revamped the star system map. The current system map allows you to click on a planet and get a full report of it including but not limited to atmosphere, terrain, orbit and rotation times, and natural satellites (moons). You then have the option to align to that planet, warp to that planet, or view that planet's map, which shows the locations of the Warp Hub, any aberrations and the Ring, if applicable.\nSystem Security Class\nThere are 5 different security statuses in Starscape, being Core, Secure, Unsecure, Contested, and Wild. Uncharted systems also exist, but are treated as Wild. Each class has different properties, different color, and each maintain other various distinct features and loot pools.\nFeatures\nCore\nSecure\nContested\nUnsecure\nWild\nPvP Enabled?\nNo\nNo\nOnly between players not enlisted in the same faction.\nYes, free-for-all\nYes, free-for-all\nServers per system\nAs many as needed to control traffic\nOne\nOne\nOne\nOne\nConsequence for ship destruction\nInventory lost, Modules lost, ship salvaged after a timer\nInventory lost, Modules lost, ship salvaged after a timer\nInventory lost, Modules lost, ship salvaged after a timer\nInventory lost, Modules lost, ship salvaged after a timer\nInventory, ship and modules are lost permanently\nStations\nAlways\nAlmost always\nNormal stations: Often, but not always\nHQ station: Always one\nOften, but not always\nNormal stations: Never\nFO: Only when it spawns3\nKorellite, Reknite Asteroids1\nInferior\nPlanetary: Regular\nAnomalies: Regular, Superior, Pristine\nPlanetary: Regular, Superior\nPristine if Mining Platform nearby\nAnomalies: Regular, Superior, Pristine\nPlanetary: Regular, Superior\nAnomalies: Regular, Superior, Pristine\nEverywhere: Regular, Superior, Pristine\nGellium Asteroids1\nNone\nPlanetary: Inferior, Regular, rarely\nAnomalies: Regular, Superior\nPlanetary: Regular, Superior\nPristine if Mining Platform nearby\nAnomalies: Regular, Superior, Pristine\nPlanetary: Regular, Superior\nAnomalies: Regular, Superior, Pristine\nEverywhere: Regular, Superior, Pristine\nAxnit Asteroids1\nNone\nPlanetary: None\nAnomalies: Regular, uncommonly\nPlanetary: Regular\nPristine if Mining Platform nearby\nAnomalies: Regular, Pristine\nPlantary: Regular\nAnomalies: Regular, Pristine\nEverywhere: Regular, Pristine\nNarcor Asteroids1\nNone\nPlanetary: None\nAnomalies: Regular, Rarely\nPlanetary: None\nAnomalies: Regular, uncommonly\nPlanetary: None\nAnomalies: Regular, uncommonly\nPlanetary: Regular, uncommonly\nAnomalies: Regular\nRed Narcor Asteroids1\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nPlanetary: None\nAnomalies: Regular, uncommonly\nVexnium Asteroids\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nPlanetary: None\nAnomalies: Regular, only in VX and R-deposits\nAnomalies\nAberrations\nNone\nAT, AL, BF, CM, WH, SP, DH, MT\nR-Deposit\nAT, AL, BF, CM, WH, SP, DH, MT, AA\nR-Deposit, X-Structure\nAT, AL, BF, CM, WH, SP, DH, MT, AA\nR-Deposit, X-Structure\nAT, AL, BF, CM, WH, SP, DH, MT, AA, AN, VX, FO\nR-Deposit, X-Structure\nDrone Fleet level\nDoes Not Spawn\nFireteam (2 waves), Squadron (3 waves)\nSquadron (3 waves), Fleet (4 waves)\nSquadron (3 waves), Fleet (4 waves)\nSquadron (3 waves)? , Fleets (4 waves), Armadas (5 waves)\nDrone Factory Level\nDoes Not Spawn\nDepot, Foundry\nDepot, Foundry, Factory\nDepot, Foundry, Factory\nFoundry, Factory, Megacomplex\nPirate den size\nDoes Not Spawn\nSmall, Medium\nSmall, Medium, Large\nSmall, Medium, Large\nMedium, Large\nWarp Disruption\nNot Allowed\nNot Allowed\nNot Allowed\nDisruptor upgrade only\nAll forms allowed; Upgrade or Deployable\nOnly concerns Asteroid Fields, Rings, or AT/AL anomalies - it's possible for pristine Korrelite, Reknite, and Gellium ores to spawn in MT anomalies, and it is possible to obtain higher quality/tier ores from NPC drops and X-structures.\nPlayers not aligned to a faction can attack and be attacked by any player.\nFO Anomalies have no storage terminals, and no ship spawning terminals. You cannot store items, and you cannot switch ships.\nNarcor can very rarely spawn around mining platforms.\n?. Requires confirmation. Please post a screenshot in the comments if you find one.\nCore\nCore Systems are typically major hubs for a particular faction; be it the capital system, or just a forward base. They are the only systems that can contain Cloning Bays (places where you can set your spawn point), and with the exception of The Citadel, you must reach Tier 3 Standing with the owning faction in order to use them. They contain little to no available loot, so most players will spend most of their time elsewhere to find better sources of wealth and entertainment. Player Marketing is very common in The Citadel and Harbor, which are the two most popular markets. Skilled marketers can make lots of money by 'flipping' in-demand items.\nThere are 18 Core Systems: 7 owned by CoreSec, 1 for each of the other 5 faction's capitals, and an extra 2 for each of the 3 military faction's staging areas.\nSecure\nSecure systems, like Core systems, don't allow PvP. They also have fairly poor opportunities for loot, and weak NPC enemies. It is generally recommended that new players remain within the vicinity of secure systems until they become skilled enough to fend for themselves in Unsecure and Wild systems. Though more dangerous systems contain better loot, with a warship miner one can semi-afk mine secure asteroid fields to gain a lot of ore to sell, with very low risk. \nThere are 254 secure systems in total.\nContested\nContested systems are unique in that they're the only systems that can actually change what faction they belong to (this is done through player conquest in the Faction Warfare system). They behave similarly to Unsecure systems and have effectively identical anomalies, resources, and NPC encounters. All forms of warp disruption are disabled. Piracy is possible there, but players can often warp away safely. Be careful with other faction players if you are enlisted in a military, as they might try killing you, either out of patriotism or for sport.\nThere are 355 different Contested systems. \nIf you are looking for more detailed information on these systems click here.\nUnsecure\nUnsecure systems are Starscape's middle ground, between civilization and chaos. They are the first systems out from the Core that allow unrestricted PvP, and are one of the most likely systems to find player pirates waiting for unsuspecting players. The risk generally goes down as you go further from the core; Emas and Gatinsir are infamous partially because they're located in core space, and are located along common routes to Faction Space hotspots - meanwhile, most Unsecure systems outside of Faction Space are generally free from pirates (one should always keep their guard up when in PvP space, though). Piracy is common in the CoreSec's unsecure systems and uncommon for other unsecure systems in different areas. \nThe three primary factions contain many unsecure systems within their respective territories. These systems maintain a mediocre loot pool, not being terrible, but not being the best either. If you are a new players looking for a step up from Secure system loot, you should probably go straight to Wild space- it is ironically more safe than Unsecure space because of the low odds of encountering others. \nIn general, avoid Unsecure Systems.\nThere are 354 different unsecure systems.\nWild\nWild systems are the final frontier, and they are divided into 7 regions: Terminus, Alteran Reach, Desolation, Olivavan Expanse, Wildar, Eternity and Ignis. All wild systems are functionally identical- a wild system bordering safe space has equal loot tables to one on the edge of the known galaxy. However, wild systems close to the Core, and all its player activity, are more likely to have been looted recently, making an artificial loot slope in which farther systems tend to have more and better loot still available. \nWild systems not only allow PvP, but have no space stations whatsoever, not counting Frontier Outposts. In addition, all forms of warp disruption are fully enabled. It is generally very difficult for developing players to stay alive in Wild systems due to the vast number of powerful Drones and NPC Pirates, and no stations to repair or hide at as a last resort. Keep in mind that you can still warp away to hide from any of the NPCs; they cannot give chase. \nPlayer pirates are less frequent in Wild, due to the sheer number of wild systems to look around in for players, but they do exist. Never let down your guard, and never go AFK. \nWild systems have the best items to offer for any player, including loot drops, ores, and anomalies. More anomalies can generate in Wild systems than anywhere else. \nThe other thing to remember with wild is that being destroyed means permanently losing your ship. This is the only system type that has this, so even though survival is arguably easier than in Unsecure, you should still be extremely careful. \nThere are 3595 different wild charted wild systems.\nUncharted Wild Systems\nUncharted systems are an unofficial variant of wild systems that are only detectable from an adjacent system. The 9 G-XX systems are currently the only known uncharted systems in the game- though of course, ZolarKeth could always add more without telling us, and we wouldn't know... \nOTHER:\nIn older versions of Starscape, the three military faction territory was smaller, and was fixed. There was no presence of Contested systems or territory changes until the Faction Warfare mechanic was introduced. \nGallery\nThe map as how it appears with security classes highlighted.The map with spectral colour shown - useful for locating sites shown on ancient beacons.The same map but spice colors are shown.How the map appeared in a much older version of Starscape.1/4",
