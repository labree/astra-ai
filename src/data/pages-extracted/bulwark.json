  "full_text": "Bulwark\n\"The Bulwark destroyer is a powerful, unyielding warship. It makes up for its lacking agility with immense firepower and defensive capabilities.\"\nThe Bulwark is the destroyer of the Stronghold line. It is a tanky, heavy-hitting warship useful in both PvP and PvE, although its lack of agility means it cannot pursue or escape from combat as effectively as other ships.\nAdvantages\nAll of the Bulwark's main turrets are on its top and bottom, allowing it to fire full broadsides like the Justice.\nThe Bulwark has 3 medium turrets and 3 small turrets, meaning that it has above-average damage output relative to most destroyers, which have 2 medium turrets and 4 small turrets. It is second in this respect only to the Loxodon, due to the Foralkan damage boost.\nIts high hull allows it to take much more damage than other destroyers can. Its closest counterpart is the Echelon, which focuses on Armor over Hull.\nDisadvantages\nThe Bulwark is very slow even among destroyers, and vulnerable to kiting in PvP. Being hull-based, kinetic weaponry can easily shred through an unwary Bulwark.\nDue to its high hull capacity, fully regenerating it takes a long time.\nTrivia\nThe current Bulwark is modeled by AVeryDandyLad.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nStronghold Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nSabre\nBulwark\nT2\nClaymore\nExotic\nHybrid Claymore",
