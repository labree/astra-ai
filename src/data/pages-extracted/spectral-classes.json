This feature didn't have a use before the Echoes of the Past update, apart from knowing what type the star of a particular system was. However, with the new Echoes of the Past update they can now be used to figure out where an Ancient Beacon map leads to.\n \nTrivia\nIn real life, spectral class (also known as stellar classification) is used to categorise stars based on their characteristics, like surface temperature, size, mass etc. Stars are usually categorised using a system called the Morgan-Keenan System, which uses the letters O, B, A, F, G, K and M, with O being the hottest and M the coolest. Each of these letters is then divided into the numbers 0-9, once again, 0 being the hottest and 9 being the coolest. This can also be used to determine the star's age.\nSo, for example, a star with the class O0 (letter o and number zero) would be the hottest and M9 would be the coolest.\nRecently, this system has been expanded, with S meaning a White Dwarf (A small, dense star that gives off little light) and C meaning a Carbon Star (A red giant with more carbon than oxygen in its atmosphere)",
