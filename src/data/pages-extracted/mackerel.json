It is best suited as a fast but heavy-hitting interceptor.\nAdvantages\nThe Mackerel's two engine slots grants high maneuverability, and it is one of the most agile fighters once fully fitted. Pilots can fly circles around targets while dealing bursts of damage with properly fitted weapon rigs.\nDisadvantages\nThe Mackerel is an T1 faction interceptor, and thus will perform poorly against its upgraded counterparts. In addition, a low hull pool causes it to be vulnerable to weapons with good tracking. It has less offensive capabilities compared to other Foralkan ships as a tradeoff for its agility.\nAs a faction ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a faction terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\n- The current Mackerel is modeled by ii_Cove.\nInterceptors\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nDefiance\nFalcon\nParagon\nHybrid Paragon\nValiance\nZenith\nPolaris\nHybrid Polaris\nMegalodon\nMackerel\nCandiru\nMandator\nParrot\nMacaw\nRighteous\nTetra\nTriazo\nMegalodon Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nMackeral\nPiranha\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nSunfish\nPtychodus\nT2\nCandiru\nThresher\nExotic",
