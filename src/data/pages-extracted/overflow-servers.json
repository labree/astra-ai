  "summary": "Overflow Servers are servers used to hold players when a system server is full. The amount of players that are needed in non-core systems for an overflow server to be created is 200. Anomalies, drone squads/fleets, and other events will not spawn in overflow servers. These servers are rarely encountered because it is difficult to have 200 players in a single system without organization, and even then, the server would likely crash due to the number of players.",
