  "full_text": "Conciliator\n\"Keeping with the tradition of Kavani design, the Conciliator is more agile (but less durable) than its counterparts produced by the other nations.\"\nThe Conciliator is a destroyer-class ship of the Mandator ship line. It is best suited as a fast, tech-focused destroyer.\nAdvantages\nThe Conciliator is agile for a destroyer, has good energy capacity/regeneration, and many subsystem slots. Used well, these allow it to heal quickly and outrun other destroyers if situations go awry.\nAs its capabilities depend on equipped subsystems, the Conciliator is extremely versatile and excellent for both PvP and PvE, depending on the build. It's turret placement is also favorable, as it allows for multiple turrets to fire no matter the angle. Special care must be given to the bottom, however, as it is the area covered by the least turrets.\nDisadvantages\nThe Conciliator is not as durable as other destroyers, sacrificing total health for speed and module slots. Due to this, players must manage their energy well. Losing all of your energy, especially in the middle of a fight, can be catastrophic; you cannot warp, cannot heal, and will most likely die a sad and expensive death. \nThe Conciliator, while being hull-based, has low armor, and is vulnerable to kinetic weaponry when hulled. Pilots must take advantage of its higher Deflection value and try to retain shields if possible.\nDue to its reliance on subsystems and rigs, the Conciliator can be expensive to replace if lost.\nAs a Kavani ship, its blueprint must be purchased using Loyalty Points at a Kavani terminal or from other players, making it less accessible to new or neutral players.\nTrivia\nThe current Conciliator is modeled by Drezzlez.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nMandator Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nCruiser\nBattleship\nT1\nParrot\nToucan\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nSubjugator\nConqueror\nT2\nMacaw\nHornbill\nExotic",
