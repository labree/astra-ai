  "full_text": "Rhino\n\"The Rhino is a hauler designed with an emphasis on speed and agility over cargo capacity. This class of ship is designed for escortless pilots who are looking to make riskier cargo runs.\"\nThe Rhino is a hauler-class ship of the Mastodon line. It is best suited as a fast and cheap hauler ship.\nAdvantages\nThe Rhino is comparably cheap compared to other fast or stealthy haulers such as the Shroud, but features more crates than the Hyrax. It is a decent upgrade for new players looking to continue a hauling career, but who cannot yet afford a warship. It is useful for solo players due to having the speed to stay safe without escorts.\nDisadvantages\nCompared to warship haulers, the Rhino is cheaper but far less useful, with about half the cargo capacity, slower speed and lower durability. It does not feature the low signal range and other stealth capabilities of the Syndicate ships nor the large cargo capacities of the Trade Union ships, but it is built for speed.\nTrivia\nThe current Rhino is modeled by DANNYboy25000.\nHaulers\nLine\nT1\nT2\nCorvette\nFrigate\nNebula\nAstero\nGalaxy\nMastodon\nHyrax\nRhinoBison\nZubron\nCloak\nVeil\nShroud",
