  "full_text": "Ozark\n\"The Ozark is a dedicated mining platform with the ability to quickly strip asteroid fields of ore using its considerable bonus to mining turret yield.\"\nThe Ozark is a miner-class ship of the Everest ship line. It is best suited as a powerful warship miner for an industrialist's first warship.\nAdvantages\nThe Ozark is the cheapest miner ship to have small turret hardpoints, allowing it to equip more efficient or specialized turrets like strip, precision, and ice miners. In addition, it is more durable and overall more powerful than fighter-style miners. \nDisadvantages\nDue to being a warship miner, it is slow compared to the fighter-style miners. While it can mine in bulks, its PDTs lend little defense due to being top-heavy, and players should take care not to be caught by any pirates. Pirates can easily destroy your ship if you are not paying attention to the playerlist. In addition, since the Ozark uses turrets, it is significantly more expensive to lose.\nTrivia\n- The current Ozark is modeled by Infranium157.\nMiners\nLine\nT1\nT2\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nBadger\nBadger\nHoney Badger\nMarlin\nMarlin\nMako\nEverest\nOzark\nKodiak\nYukon\nEos\nKoronis\nEos\nVesta",
