  "full_text": "Infinity\n\"The Infinity is a corvette designed with a focus around rapid response, having a comparatively flat warp speed and charge time, as well as substantial damage and shield regen. However, its lack of overall hull and shield durability make it susceptible to melting under pressure.\"\nThe Infinity is a corvette-class ship of the Valiance ship line. It is best suited as a quickly-healing kiting ship.\nAdvantages\nThe Infinity has admirable agility and shield regen compared to other corvettes. As a corvette, it does not cost a lot, and it is one of the best entry-level long-range PvP warships. The Infinity also excels in kiting as it has good speed, a combat module and great shield regen.\nDisadvantages\nThe Infinity is not very durable, and if caught off guard, pilots will find that the regeneration only becomes useful for distance combat. As such, it is not the best drone hunting or PvP brawling due to the large immediate DPS coming at the ship.\nTrivia\n- The current Infinity is modeled by Jeff_D.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nValiance Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nZenith\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortiude\nT2\nPolaris\nExotic\nHybrid Polaris",
