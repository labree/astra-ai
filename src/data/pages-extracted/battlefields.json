  "full_text": "Battlefields\nBattlefields are naturally occurring features that generate in planetary Warp Hubs and BF anomalies. As the loot offered is rather poor and also time-consuming to collect, most players completely ignore them.\nStructurally, battlefields are a group of wrecked ships with small loot containers scattered throughout. Drones often spawn throughout the wreckage field. Possible loot includes junk, weapons, armor, materials or some standing items for the Trade Union, Mining Guild, Syndicate, and CoreSec, not including Drone Cores.\nThe loot containers' icons will only become visible when the player gets close. They can spawn around, on, or inside shipwrecks. When looted, the containers will disappear. Warp Hub battlefields regenerate crates over time, but BF anomaly battlefields do not. BF anomalies will become deadspace once all loot containers are collected.\nThe \"Salvage Operation\" mission will spawn a battlefield inside a minefield, but this type has mission cargo instead of item crates. This type also still uses the old ship models from before the Next Gen update.\nTrivia\nShipwrecks that can spawn in these graveyard include neutral fighters, small miners, transports, Syndicate freighters, and military faction cruisers.\nLoot container models are identical to the containers ejected by player ships.\nThe Kavani Cruiser wreckage will only spawn weapons or armor in its loot crates.",
