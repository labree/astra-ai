  "full_text": "Missions\nMissions are repeatable quests that all seven factions can give to the player, providing rewards of credits, skill points, and standing with that particular faction. Some missions can also indirectly reduce standing against an enemy faction if they involve destroying faction ships.\nAccepting Missions\n \nIn order to accept a mission, one must first find an agent of the corresponding faction in their field office, which can be found in most military stations throughout their territory. The agent's tier must be less than or equal to the player's standing tier with said faction, otherwise the agent will not give missions to the player.\nAgents of higher tiers can give missions of lower tiers than their tier, but agents of lower tiers cannot give higher-tier missions than they are.\nYou can find agents of your tier using the Agent Finder tool on the map sidebar, as seen on the right.\nMinimum Necessary Standing\nTier\nRequirement\nLevel 0\n-499\nLevel 1\n500\nLevel 2\n1500\nLevel 3\n2500\nLevel 4\n3500\nLevel 5\n4500\nMission Tiers\nTwo skill buffs in the Commerce constellation can modify these values. \"Negotiations\" will increase credit rewards by 5% per level, and \"Diplomacy\" will increase standing and loyalty points by 5% per level.\nThe \"Destroy: \" mission has higher credit and double the standing reward compared to other missions of the same tier.\nMission Rewards (Military Factions + CoreSec)\nCredits\nSkill Points\nStanding/Loyalty\nStanding/Loyalty (Destroy Mission)\nT0\n500\n50\n20\n-\nT1\n750\n50\n30\n60\nT2\n1250\n200\n40\n-\nT3\n1500\n300\n50\n100\nT4\n2500\n400\n75\n-\nT5\n3750\n500\n100\n200\nMission Rewards (Trade Union + Mining Guild) - 1.25x credits\nCredits\nSkill Points\nStanding/Loyalty\nT0\n625\n50\n20\nT1\n937\n50\n30\nT2\n1562\n200\n40\nT3\n1875\n300\n50\nT4\n3125\n400\n75\nT5\n4688\n500\n100\nMission Rewards (Syndicate) - 1.5x credits\nCredits\nSkill Points\nStanding/Loyalty\nStanding/Loyalty (Destroy Mission)\nT0\n750\n50\n20\n-\nT1\n1125\n50\n30\n60\nT2\n1875\n200\n40\n-\nT3\n2250\n300\n50\n100\nT4\n3750\n400\n75\n-\nT5\n5625\n500\n100\n200\nTypes of Missions\n\nOffice Supply Run\nUse a hauler ship to grab supplies from an outpost in another system and bring them back to the station where the agent is. Tier 0 missions need 2 cargoes to be transported, tier 2 needs 6, tier 4 needs 10.\nMission Quote:\n\"The field office is running out of supplies and won't be able to keep running in top condition much longer. Go to an outpost to pick up supplies and bring them back to the station. This mission requires a Hauler-class ship to complete.\"\nResupply the Outpost\nUse a hauler ship to grab supplies from the source station and deliver them to another outpost. Tier 0 missions need 2 cargoes to be transported, tier 2 needs 6, tier 4 needs 10.\nMission Quote:\n\"A listening post is in need of a resupply. Your task is to pick up the cargo and deliver it to the outpost. This mission requires a Hauler-class ship to complete.\"\nLaw Enforcement\nWarp to a system's asteroid field (often two systems away) to scare away pirates and reactivate proximity alarms (X number of them, scattered on asteroids) while fending off pirates occasionally. The pirates will always come back with a full fleet. Tier 0 missions need 3 alarms to be activated with only 2 fighters (Sabre, Aurora) and 2 interceptors (Zenith, Falcon) appearing. Tier 2 needs 4 alarms with a corvette (Radix) added to the fleet (CoreSec, needs confirmation on other factions). Tier 4 needs 5 alarms with another corvette added to the fleet (Chevron) (needs confirmation on other factions). \nMission Quote:\n\"A nearby asteroid field which was designated an excavation site is being illegally mined by a group of pirates. Go to the asteroid field, drive off the pirates, and reactivate the proximity alert systems the pirates disabled.\"\nDefend the Transport\nWarp to a system to defend a transport ship from 3 small waves of enemies, with the enemies depending on the faction's relations:\nKavani enemies: Lycentian, Foralkan\nForalkan enemies: Lycentian, Kavani\nLycentian enemies: Kavani, Foralkan\nCoreSec enemies: Drones\nTrade Union enemies: Pirates\nMining Guild enemies: Pirates\nSyndicate enemies: Drones, Pirates\nDifficulty is only raised by an additional corvette appearing on tier 2 missions. Tier 4 missions do not raise the difficulty from tier 2 (possibly unintended).\nThe transport has approximately 250k hull. It cannot be destroyed unless the player makes a concentrated and deliberate attempt to do so.\nDoing this mission will significantly reduce your standing with the enemy faction. If you are trying to retain positive standing with the other factions, then avoid this mission.\nMission Quote:\n\"A transport took engine damage and is currently stranded in a potentially hostile region of space. Travel to its location and ensure it is able to complete its repairs safely.\"\nIntel Recovery\nWarp to a system to collect information, there are 4 different scenarios that will randomize the mission: \nThe covert ship is ready to give information as you arrive. (Always the first scenario, and will be on every mission)\nThe covert ship is destroyed, the first part requires you to find the black box. Then the 2nd part requires you to fight pirates or faction ships to get the intel. Difficulty of this scenario is parallel to the Law Enforcement mission.\nThe covert ship is under attack, it has the same difficulty as the 2nd scenario.\nThe covert ship's pilot thinks you've betrayed him, and goes insane. Difficulty does not raise.\nThe Covert Ops ship has approximately 100k shield. It cannot be destroyed unless the player makes a concentrated and deliberate attempt to do so.\nMission Quote:\n\" employs a number of covert ops ships which procure intelligence on pirate, drone, and other unlawful operations. Your task is to rendezvous with these covert ships, retrieve their reports, and return them to the field office\"\nAssault the Base\nDestroy a base (type of base and ships that appear vary between which faction you are doing the mission for), often comprising of 2 factories and a outpost. The user have to counter 3 waves of ships comprising of fighters, corvettes and interceptors. No more ships will spawn after the waves of ships are destroyed. It is not necessary to destroy the factories beside the bases -- no new ships will spawn after the 3 waves of ships are destroyed. It is however necessary to destroy all 3 waves before the base can take damage. Tier 1 missions require you to fight corvettes and fighters (drone interceptors). Tier 3 missions will have frigates added to the fleet. \nDoing this mission will significantly reduce your standing with the enemy faction. If you are trying to retain positive standing with the other factions, then avoid this mission.\n \nMission Quote:\n\" intelligence has learned the location of a secret base nearby. Travel to the location of the base and destroy it and all its defenses.\"\nSalvage Operation\nSalvage the cargo remains from a destroyed fleet. Use a hauler class ship, preferably a small and agile one, to navigate through a mine field, and collect cargo crates from destroyed ships. Cargo amount increases with mission difficulty (Tier 1: 2 cargo, Tier 3: 5 cargo, Tier 5: 8 cargo)\nMission Quote: \n\"A transport ship on a risky mission got trapped and destroyed in a minefield. Go to the wreckage site and salvage the cargo crates it was transporting. This mission requires a Hauler-Class ship to complete \"\nRescue Operation\nProtect a transport from enemy fighters, interceptors and corvettes while it is rescuing a prisoner. Difficulty raises by more corvettes, fighters and turrets added into the fleet (Tier 1, 3 and 5).\nThe transport has approximately 250k hull. It cannot be destroyed unless the player makes a concentrated and deliberate attempt to do so.\nMission Quote:\n\"A technician was servicing a outpost when hostile ships assaulted it, overrunning its defenses and stranding the technician. is sending a transport to retrieve the technician, but it needs you to protect it from the hostiles in the area.\"\nDestroy: Drones/Foralkus/Lycentia/Kavani\nDestroy a given set of ships (the type of ships varies between factions), often 10 Fighters and either 10 interceptors or 5 corvettes. The rewards are higher at 500 Credits and +60 Faction Standing for Tier 1. At Tier 3, you have to destroy 10 fighters, interceptors and corvettes each or 10 corvettes and 3 frigates, giving a higher reward at 1000 Credits and +80 Faction Standing. At Tier 5, You need to destroy 10 fighters, interceptors, corvettes and 3 frigates for 1600 credits and +100 faction standing. (For non-CoreSec missions, corvettes are after tier 3, frigates are the only ship on tier 5. however, there are ten frigates needed.)\nMission Quotes:\nCoreSec/Syndicate:\n\"Drones have been encroaching further and further into civilized space. Destroy them wherever you find them across the galaxy to prevent the problem from getting any worse.\"\nLycentian:\n\"It is difficult to find an entity in the galaxy the Foralkans have not agitated, and the Federation is no exception. Help turn the tide in the conflict by destroying Foralkan ships wherever you can find them across the galaxy.\"\n\"The conflict with the Kavani has gone on for generations. As the two original great nations, the Federation and the Mandate were destined to be at odds. Help turn the tide in the conflict by destroying Kavani ships wherever you can find them across the galaxy.\"\nKavani:\n\"The conflict with the Lycentians has gone on for generations. As the two original great nations, Lycentia and Kavani were destined to be at odds. Help turn the tide in the conflict by destroying Lycentian ships wherever you can find them across the galaxy.\"\n\"It is difficult to find an entity in the galaxy the Foralkans have not agitated, and the Mandate is no exception. Help turn the tide in the conflict by destroying Foralkan ships wherever you can find them across the galaxy.\"\nForalkan:\n\"The Kavani believe they have a mandate, but the empire disagrees. Help turn the tide in the conflict by destroying Kavani ships wherever you can find them across the galaxy.\"\n\"The Lycentians and Foralkans have been bitter enemies since the rise of the Empire. Help turn the tide in the conflict by destroying Lycentian ships wherever you can find them across the galaxy.\"\nSummary of Missions\nTYPES OF MISSIONS\nMission Name\nMission details\nT0\nT1\nT2\nT3\nT4\nT5\nOffice Supply Run\nUse a Hauler Class ship to deliver supplies from an outpost to a station, normally 2-3 systems away.\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nSupply the Outpost\nUse a Hauler Class ship to deliver supplies from a station to an outpost, normally 2-3 systems away.\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nLaw Enforcement\nDestroy a fleet of pirates mining illegally at an asteroid field 2-4 systems away, and reactivate proximity alarms.\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nDefend the Transport\nDefend a transport ship from 3 small waves of enemies, until it has finished repairing its engines.\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nIntel Recovery\nCollect intel from covert ops ship, requiring the player to visit 2-4 covert ops ship to gain intel.\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nAssault the Base\nDestroy 3 waves of enemies, and then the enemy base.\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nDestroy: (Enemy)\nDestroy a given number and type of enemies of the faction.\n✔\n✔\n✔\nSalvage Operation\nUse a Hauler class ship to travel into a minefield, salvaging 2-10 crates from the wreckage.\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nRescue Operation\nDefend a transport ship which is saving a stranded technician on an overrun station.\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔",
