  "full_text": "This article covers character armor. For the defensive ship stat, see Armor plating.\nArmor is a player item which aids players in station PvP. Similar to firearms, armor is only effective in core or secure duels, unsecure space, where PVP is enabled and there are stations to land in, and in wild FO anomalies.\nArmor has a deflection value, which is basically the percentage of damage it can block. (Ex: if a blaster deals 10 damage and a armor has a deflect value of 50, the blaster will deal only 5 damage to the target.) Armor only protects the specific body part, legs protect legs, torso protects the torso and the arms and, the helmet protects the head.\n\nLighter armor offers less protection in exchange for better move speed. There are five sets of light armor available in the game and each set consists of 3 parts.
