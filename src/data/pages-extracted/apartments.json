  "full_text": "Apartments\nApartments are enterable rooms found within residential space stations (indicated by on the quick-warp menu) scattered around the galaxy, serving as the main feature of the stations. They are structures that provide a living quarter you can rent for a fee, the price dependent on the type of apartment chosen. They serve little gameplay function other than to decorate with furniture or rewards you have purchased/earned during normal gameplay, though many players use them as bases for faction events or roleplay scenarios.\nRenting an apartment costs a fixed charge per day - though the minimum rent duration is 7 days - and players can prepay rent for up to 30 days at a time. Once your lease ends, you lose the ability to re-enter your apartment unless you or another player rent the apartment again and all the items displayed in the apartment are returned to the occupant's storage.\nStarscape currently offers 3 different choices of apartments.\nThe Studio\n \nThe studio apartment is the smallest but cheapest option available, intended for use by a single person. There are 4 on each level they are present, those being levels 1 to 11. Renting one costs 80 credits a day, or a minimum of 560 credits for 7 days.\nThe Double\n \nThe middle-of-the-road option, this apartment is about twice the size of the studio apartment. There are 2 on each floor they are present, being floors 12 to 19. They cost 150 credits to rent per day, or a minimum of 1050 credits for 7 days.\nThe Penthouse\n \nThe largest and most expensive residence, this apartment takes up an entire floor, incorporating 2 studio apartments as well as a space in the middle of the apartment that is used as a divider. It is typically reserved for players using their apartment to host faction events. This room is always found by itself on the 20th floor of each tower in the station - how many penthouses there are depend on how many towers are present in the station. They cost 520 credits per day, or 3640 credits for 7 days minimum.",
