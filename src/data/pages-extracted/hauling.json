  "full_text": "Hauling\nHauling is the process of shipping cargo crates of various Cargo Items to and from locations with hauling ships. Hauling can be used to earn credits and is essential in Faction Warfare to create defense structures. This overview of hauling will be split up into three sections: Methods, Sources, and Strategies.\nMethods\nMilitary Supply Hauling\nPick up supplies from a Staging Area system, then haul them to a nonstronghold Contested HQ owned by the faction you are enlisted in for some credits and Loyalty Points/Standing. You must be enlisted in a military faction.\nPick up supplies from a Staging Area system, then haul them to a Constructor in a Contested System owned by the faction you are enlisted in. This method has near insignificant worth in terms of credits, but progress is made towards building a defense structure, such as a mining platform or shipyard, and one point of reputation per crate for the faction you're assisting. You must be enlisted in a military faction.\nMercantile Supply Hauling: \nPurchase Trade Union or Syndicate supplies from Harbor or Syndica respectively, then haul them to a nonstronghold contested HQ owned by the faction you are enlisted in for the purpose of gaining lots of credits. You must be enlisted in a military faction, and have money to buy the Supply Crates.\nWH/FO Hauling (Gemstone Hauling)\nWH/FO hauling is a luck-based activity that can produce hundreds of thousands of credits. Go out into Wilds in a hauler, find an FO anomaly, find a WH anomaly nearby that leads to the opposite side of the galaxy, then find another FO anomaly on the other side of the WH. Haul Gemstone Spice between the FOs until it stops being profitable.\n(Colored) Spice Hauling\n(Colored) Spices are a type of cargo item that can be bought and sold with Hauler class ships. They can be obtained from Spice Platforms, which spawn as features in Warp Hubs in Secure, Contested, and Unsecure space, and SP anomalies. Profit can be made by acquiring spices at one platform and selling them to a non-residential station or FO. Spices come in different colors, and each color sells for the most money the farther away from its area.\nHauling missions\nIn order to receive a hauling mission, the player must first find a faction agent in a Field Office. The agent's tier must be equal to or lower than that of the player's tier standing with the corresponding faction in order to give the player a mission. The higher the tier of the mission, the more generous the rewards are. Hauling missions have no extra NPC threat in them, but naturally-spawned NPCs in Warp Hubs and Rings are still a threat to you. In Unsecure, Contested, and Wild systems, players are also a threat.\nWormhole hauling\nSimilar to WH/FO hauling, but with normal spice instead of FO gemstone spice. This is preferred over other methods due to being more common and safer. First, find a secure-secure wormhole. Then, make sure that the wormhole extends to opposite sides of the Core. Locate nearby spice platforms and stations, and start trading! Finding the right wormhole can still be difficult.\nLocations\nLocations are the different places players can haul, ranging from spice platforms and cargo docks to hidden scannable anomalies.\nLocations\nLocation\nInfo\nSpice Platforms\nThe most common source of spice. It is recommended to buy for cheap, and sell at a cargo dock for a high price. This can be very profitable if done correctly by a smart, patient player, although it can be slow. These can spawn in Secure, Contested, and Unsecure systems.\nSP Anomalies\nRarer, but can be a good source. SP anomalies can give free spice, defended by drones. In Wild space, the spice has a chance of being Gemstone. These can spawn in any system except Core.\nFO Anomalies\nA rare Wild anomaly, used to reliably obtain Gemstone spices. See WH/FO hauling. FO cargo docks are able to both sell gemstone spice and buy gemstone and regular spice.\nSupply Docks\nMainly for faction supply hauling, supply docks can be found under stations in Staging Core systems, as well as in Syndica and Harbor. These allow you to pick up the faction's respective supply crates. Staging Areas dispense supplies for free, and Syndica and Harbor sell supplies for 100 credits per crate.\nStrategies / Tips and Tricks\nWithout the Hauling skill, each cargo slot taken will reduce the max speed of the ship by 1.25%.\nWith the max amount of cargo slot being 30, this means you can achieve a max speed reduction of up to 37.5%\nWith the Hauling skill maxed, each cargo slot taken will instead reduce the max speed by 0.9375%. With 30 cargo slots, that's 28.125%\nAvoid Unsecure systems. These are the most frequently pirated.\nNever go AFK, as even a single drone fighter could kill you.\nSpice prices start around 300 per crate. If the cost is more than 350, then there is at least one other player already using this route.\nHaul until the buy price is equal to or greater than the sell price in order to maximize your profits.\nONLY HAUL IF YOU HAVE TIME TO BURN.\nWhen doing risky runs, always take the longer route.\nTU supply hauling is less lucrative than Syndicate supply hauling, but far safer and more time efficient.\nTry to haul the longest distance routes in order to net the most profit.\nOther Information\nFor every empty cargo slot, one may have 500 cubic meters of extra inventory space, in exchange for that cargo slot.",
