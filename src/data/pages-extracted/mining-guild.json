  "full_text": "Mining Guild\nThe Mining Guild is a new mercantile faction that was added in the Getting Around update. Notably, it is not in the Core but rather in wild space, like the Syndicate.\nBackground\nThe Mining Guild is an industrial cooperative operating in wild space. It focuses on the recovery of bulk and scarce ores for sale on the galactic market. Due to its isolated nature, the Mining Guild utilizes a fleet of proprietary mining ships which have enhanced cargo capacities to support extended mining operations.\nMilitary\n \nThe Mining Guild has a military, with patrols being able to be found in their territory. Players cannot sign up for the Mining Guild's military.\nPolitics\nThe Galactic Mining Guild is a worker owned cooperative, effectively owned by its workers. The Galactic Mining Guild has neutral relations with the 3 major factions, CoreSec, and the Syndicate, however it has slightly negative relations with the Trade Union, as they are the main rival company of the Guild. Trade Union freighters can still spawn in Mining Guild territory.\nStanding\nMain Article: Faction Standing\nFaction standing represents your relationship with each NPC faction. Completing missions or turning in certain items will increase your standing, while destroying their ships will lower your standing.
