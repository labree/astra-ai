  "full_text": "Luminar\n\"Based on the Aurora chassis, the Luminar is an advanced fighter whose heavy shields give it a distinct advantage in combat situations.\"\nThe Luminar is a fighter-class ship of the Legionis ship line. It is best suited as a balanced, shield-focused fighter, and is the upgraded version of the Aurora.\nAdvantages\nThe Luminar offers an excellent blend of higher DPS and maneuverability, able to reliably dodge small weapon turrets, and skirmish with other fighters. This makes it a good filler ship, able to chase down interceptors without being as susceptible to warships as the Polaris. Due to its large shield pool, it is durable against kinetic PDTs as well.\nDisadvantages\nWhile its shields are beefy and the ship itself is effective against other Fighters and Interceptors, the Luminar can still be as easily overwhelmed. The Luminar is most powerless before other Fighter-Sized ships with superior energy capacity and/or management that can keep disruptive subsystems active and heavily exploit the Luminar's inability to retaliate.\nTrivia\n- The current Luminar is modeled by Jeff_D.\nFighters\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nLegionis\nAurora\nLuminar\nHybrid Luminar\nStronghold\nSabre\nClaymore\nHybrid Claymore\nMegalodon\nPiranha\nThresher\nMandator\nToucan\nHornbill\nRighteous\nLuster\nLucent\nConstellation\nStratos\nLegionis Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nAurora\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nT2\nLuminar\nExotic\nHybrid Luminar",
