  "summary": "Drone Fleets are events where large groups of Drones spawn over a planet or in a planetary ring. Drone Fleets can spawn in any system in the game except for Core or Uncharted systems.

  "full_text": "Drone Fleets are events where large groups of Drones spawn over a planet or in a planetary ring. Drone Fleets can spawn in any system in the game except for Core or Uncharted systems. Drone Fleets can have 2 to 5 waves, with more waves meaning more powerful drones and better loot. 5-wave Drone Fleets are the only way to spawn a Drone Battleship.\nWhen warping into a planet with a Drone Fleet, ship icons will appear at the top of the player's screen, one for each wave of the fleet. The final wave of a fleet will spawn with a Command Drone, the type depending on the tier of the fleet. In order to complete a wave, the player must destroy all drones in the wave, or, in the case of the final wave, destroy the Command ship. When the Command ship is destroyed, the rest of the fleet will remain, but when a Drone Battleship spawns (5-wave fleets), the remainder of the fleet will warp away. \nOnce a wave has been completed, a new wave of drones will warp in. Waves that have been successfully cleared will appear as a checkmark icon in the top GUI. The current wave will have a green progress bar starting at the bottom of the icon and rising to the top as the remaining ships are destroyed. The number of remaining ships in the current wave is also listed at the top in text form. \n\n2-wave Drone Fireteams will spawn a Drone Squad Leader on the final wave, and can only be found in Secure Systems.\n3-wave Drone Squadrons will spawn a Drone Squad Leader or a Drone Lieutenant on the final wave. Squadrons can be found throughout Secure, Contested, and Unsecure space.\n4-wave Drone Fleets will spawn a Drone Lieutenant or a Drone Commander on the final wave. They can be found in Contested, Unsecure, and Wild systems.\n5-wave Drone Armadas will spawn a Drone Commander or a Drone Captain on the final wave. 5-wave Fleets can only be found in Wild systems. Upon destroying the command ship, a Drone Battleship has a 10% chance of spawning.\n\nIt is recommended to use a large ship like a destroyer in a 5-wave or 4-wave fleet due to the vast quantities of enemies. However, if destroyers are not available to you, here are some strategies to avoid dying as a frigate or corvette. \n1. Avoid the Drone Captain: The Drone Captain is a destroyer-type command ship that has much more health than the Drone Commander. Its damage is also significantly higher than a Commander. If you want to avoid fighting a Captain, you can rejoin the game, which will typically respawn the command ship as a Commander.\n2. Range: When the final wave comes in, make sure you are far away from the Captain/Commander's escorts. Only fire on the command drone, and try to bait it to leave the fleet and come after you alone. Some useful turrets for this strategy are Railguns and Beams (due to longer range).\n3. Get another player: If you are new at Drone Hunting, bringing a friend along to help you fight the fleets can be a great way to reduce risk. However, make sure that they are trustworthy, so that you don't end up getting killed by them if they feel like taking all the loot for themselves. Also, keep in mind that friendly fire cannot be disabled, so keep track of where your friend is so that you don't end up accidentally shooting each other.\n4. Do not attempt to tank the final wave of a 5-wave fleet. There will be countless Elite Frigates and Destroyers, and even if you have a Destroyer your health will be rapidly shredded. Before defeating the final drone of the 4th wave, put as much distance as you can between you and the fleet, and then try to lure away the enemy warships one by one (if you're interested in destroying them for any reason).\n\nDrone Squad Leaders can use either the Drone fighter or Interceptor model, Drone Lieutenants the Corvette model, Drone Commanders the Frigate model, and Drone Captains the Destroyer model. They all have the same white and blue color scheme.\nDrone Admirals, which are Command Cruisers, exist, but currently can only be spawned by the developer.\n ",
