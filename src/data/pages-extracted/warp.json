  "full_text": "Warp\nWarping is the method of long-distance space travel in Starscape, allowing ships to travel between points of interest in star systems and across the star cluster. All ships have the ability to warp, though the speed and charge time varies. Some modules affect warp speed and charge time. Warp speed is measured in AU/s (astronomical units per second). \nThe name for the drives responsible allowing a ship to travel medium/long distance is called a LOSSI Drive. However, it isn’t made clear if whether this is for both warping and lightcruising or just light-cruising. You can find the name of the drive by attempting to light-cruise immediately after exiting the light-cruise, in which the game will alert you, notifying that the Lossi drive needs to recharge.\nYou can warp to planets, anomalies, mission locations, and other solar systems.\nThere are three ways to initiate warp:\nAim at your destination's warp icon with the cursor and press F. Your ship will align and warp.\nHold SPACE to open the quick warp menu, then move your mouse over your desired destination. Release SPACE to select and warp there.\nOpen the system map with N or the galaxy map with M, select your desired destination, and click \"Warp\". The map will close, and your ship will align and start charging to warp.\nLightcruise\n \nLightcruising is used to move between locations around a single planet. You can lightcruise through the N map or the Quickwarp menu. Unlike warping, aligning to lightcruise does not point you directly at the destination. Rather, it angles you into orbit so that you can arc to your destination around the planet.\nWormholes\n \nSee article: Wormholes \nUpon entering a Wormhole, the ship will enter the wormhole and after a few seconds the WH will pulse once, signalling that your ship has entered the WH. Then the system loading screen will appear, and the player will get warped to the system the wormhole leads to, and will exit the warp at a second WH anomaly linked to the first. Your warp speed is displayed as ???. Warp speed stats do not affect wormhole travel.\nBehavior and Mechanics\nWhen a destination is selected to warp, the ship will slow to a full stop and begin alignment, pointing in the direction of the selected destination. Depending on the direction and angle the ship is pointing, this process may take anywhere from 1 to 5 seconds. If the destination is within the star system, such as a planet, anomaly, or mission location, then the ship will then enter warp. The ship will increase in speed until it is about halfway to its destination, in which it will begin decelerating until it reaches the destination. Some modules will effect the speed at which your ship aligns and warps.\nIf the destination is another star system, the engines then charge up. Charging takes several seconds and varies between ships. The ship will then enter warp, and will increase in speed until Roblox teleports the player to a new server. Then, the player will join a new server and enter the next system. The amount of time it takes to travel from one place to another is dependent on the ship’s warp stats and modules while ingame, and the player's internet connection speed while changing servers.\nIn the destination system, the player will arrive at whatever planet happens to be closest to the system they are coming from, dependent on the time and orbital periods.\nAlignment or charging can be cancelled at any time by pressing “X”, up until the ship begins warping..\nWhen warping from a Secure System to an Unsecure, Contested, or Wild System, a prompt will appear asking to confirm warping to the system, as PVP is enabled in those systems.\nIf the player is in a squad, squad members will be shown in the planet/anomaly/aberration they are in, which lets the player to warp to them, even if the anomaly is undiscovered, or is hidden (eg: beacon locations, mission locations). \nShips cannot enter warp while inside a space station.\nShips can warp through solid objects, including stations, asteroids, players, NPCs, planets, and stars.\nEnergy requirements\nType\nEnergy required\nWormhole\n0%\nLightcruise\n10%\nSystem\n20%\nInterstellar\n40%\nWhen entering a system, a ship regains 40% of its energy capacity to compensate for the interstellar warp energy requirement. This means travel will never take longer due to warp energy costs.\nWarp logging\n“Warp logging” is a term given to the act of logging out mid-warp. This is mostly done by players in PVP-enabled systems as a way to escape other players, as leaving the game before entering the next system prevents the player from rejoining Roblox, thus “pausing” the warp until the player rejoins the game, keeping the player’s ship and goods safe and sound. Upon rejoining the game, the warp will resume.\nThis only works between systems, not between planets or aberrations.\nWarp Disrupting\nSee also: Warp Disruptor/Disruptor Upgrade\n Warp disruptors generate a field of energy preventing any ships within the affected radius from entering warp. Upon attempting to warp, an error message will appear and the warp process will not initiate. The words “WARP DISRUPTED” will appear above the health/shield bar when within the disruptor’s radius. \nDisruption does not affect lightcruising, or the use of Wormholes, or the Lightburner subsystem.\nKnown Issues\nCommon issues within Roblox servers with teleporting can occur. When warping between systems:\nRoblox may give an error message (such as 737) while in warp.\nWarp speed and time may grow indefinitely when warping out of a system if the Roblox teleport fails.\nBecause of lag on your end, your ship can take damage while in warp (if you were being shot at when you warped away)\nLeaving and rejoining the game is the fastest and most effective way to fix these issues.",
