  "full_text": "Death\nIn a semi-hardcore game like Starscape, you should expect to “die” against your will at some point. However, there is no true death as you will still respawn in a cloning bay and indefinitely live on. In this case, death would be in the form of your ship getting destroyed or dying on a station.\nRespawning\nWhen you die in Starscape, you respawn at the Cloning Bay you have set your spawn at, which is by default The Citadel.\nWhen ranking up to a high level in NPC factions (excluding CoreSec, as you can set your spawn at The Citadel regardless of standing), you can gain \"Cloning Rights\", which can be used in that corresponding faction's Core, letting you respawn there instead of the regular Citadel spawn. To set your spawn at your faction's core, find their cloning bay, located on their main Core, and set your spawn using credits at the terminal at the far end of the room. \nShip and equipment loss\nWhen you die as a clone (while in a station) then you lose your inventory and all your equipped gear. Your clothing, including shirts and pants, but not armour and weapons, is kept and is available in your inventory upon respawning. \nIf you die in a spaceship in non-wild space, you lose your inventory, all your equipped gear, and all modules1 equipped to your ship. Your ship will be repaired for free over time and can be retrieved from the terminal in any Repair Bay. You can optionally use credits to instantly repair it. Your clothing, including shirts and pants, but not armor and weapons, is kept and is available in your inventory upon respawning. \nIf you die in a spaceship in wild space, you lose your inventory, all your equipped gear, all modules1 equipped to your ship, and your ship is permanently lost. Your clothing, including shirts and pants, but not armour and weapons, is kept and is available in your inventory upon respawning. \nIf you die as a clone in an FO in wild space, you lose your inventory and all your equipped gear. Your ship is safe. Your clothing, including shirts and pants, but not armour and weapons, is kept and is available in your inventory upon respawning. \n1Some combat skills exist which allow you a chance of keeping some of your modules.\nComing to terms with death\nYou will die and lose ships. It's a part of the game. Your aim should be being economically stable enough that dying doesn't set you back too far. Don't bring a ship into unsecure or wild systems if you can't afford to lose it (Especially Wild). Don't use your most expensive ship to learn how to fight, as it could be destroyed. Use cheaper ships while you are learning, then move on to more expensive ones when you are confident in your ability to survive ( Mandator Line reccommended). You will feel emotionally disconnected after losing valuable ships, but you must remember that 1, this is always a learning point and 2, it’s not the end of the world.",
