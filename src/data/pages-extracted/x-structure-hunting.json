  "full_text": "X-structure hunting\n\nIntroduction\nX-structure hunting refers to a kind of Wild space exploration, in which the player look for X-structure aberrations, with the goal of looting them and possibly discovering a rare Ancient Beacon.\nMost forms of X-structure hunting requires knowing how to survive in Wild systems, such as knowing what to do when another player warps in or avoiding NPC threats.\nRecommended ships\nAny ship can hack and loot X-structures, but the best ships to use are small fighters for quick missions and larger, stealthy haulers for long-term trips in Wild space.\nFighters, like the Stratos, Paragon, and Polaris, are suitable for short-period missions of a couple hours because of how quickly they can transport you across different systems in search of X-structures. They are also relatively cheap compared to other options, meaning that losing them won't put a huge dent in your bank account (especially in the case of the Stratos, which respawns in your arsenal upon death).\nIf you encounter any unknown players in your same system, warp out immediately. Fast as your fighter may be, it's still frail and easy to destroy for any experienced player.\nHaulers, especially those from the Veil and Hyrax lines, are excellent choices for long-term missions spanning several days. While they don't warp as quickly as their fighter counterparts, their extra cargo slots can prove useful for storing hundreds of dollars' worth of loot. They can also tank a fair bit more than the fighters, so you have a slightly larger margin of error should you slip up in front of hostile NPCs.\nDespite all of this, you should be even more cautious in a hauler while X-hunting than you would be in a fighter. Your DPS, no matter if you're in a stock Hyrax or decked-out Shroud, will almost always be pitiful against a pirate, and losing something of that size usually means a few days of regrinding.\nNote with a hauler that you must store your items through the cargo dock at the bottom of a station, as haulers cannot dock with crates attached.\nTips\nWhile Unsecure and Contested systems also have a chance to contain X-structures, Wild space has the best loot out of all systems and is also the only region of space where Ancient Beacon satellites can spawn.\nYou should ideally make your trips to Wild space via a secure-wild Wormhole or through your faction's contested systems. Avoid the Wildar sector because of the proximity to the Syndicate (a popular pirate hotspot), and try to get to the outer rings of systems for maximum safety from players.\nCheck Anomalies and Deposits while X-structure hunting; you might find something valuable to come back for later.\nNon-ring aberrations (e.g. around a ringless world or outside of a ringed world's ring system) are guaranteed to be X-structures. Aberrations that spawn inside of a ring are most often Deposits, but can also occasionally be X-structures.\nThere is a very slim chance for ancient items to spawn in regular structures, but most of your loot will be raw materials (both in ore or refined form) and scrap metal.\nWater and Vexnium are unable to spawn in X-structures in any form.",
