  "full_text": "Hackable Crate\nA hackable crate is a locked crate found at Structures. Unlike immediately accessible crates, a hackable crate's light glows red while locked, and green once unlocked.\nTo open a hackable crate you need to complete a labyrinth-like puzzle that consists of moving a grid probe in the shape of a glowing yellow circle to the opposite corner of the window without touching a red wall, when completed you will be able to take whatever is in the crate which is usually large amounts of ore. Upon failing, like running out of time or keep running into the red grid barrier, you will be locked out for 3-5 minutes, forcing players to manually wait until they can hack the crates again. If such player like a pirate enters the structure aberration you are in, you also always have the option to abort the hack, causing the crate to be locked out for a specified amount of time. Crates with more valuable loot will have a harder hacking minigame and less time, causing players to be quick on hacking if they want what is inside the loot. (Note: To control the yellow circle, you must use your WASD or arrow keys) \n \n \nPossible Loot:\nScrap\nReknite: ore or refined\nKorrelite: ore or refined\nGellium: ore or refined\nAxnit: ore or refined\nNarcor: ore or refined\nRed Narcor: ore or refined\nAncient Beacon: Found only in Access Panels on Satellite X-Structures in Wild space.\nAncient Turrets - Often found in crates in Intact X-Structures, rarely found in crates in regular X-Structures\nAncient Modules - Often found in crates in Intact X-Structures, rarely found in crates in regular X-Structures\n \n ",
