After warping to the Anomaly, There will be a wrecked Spice Platform with a few Drones around it, and Spices cannot be purchased or sold at the platform. Depending on what color of spice the system is, the Spice tower will have floating crates of Spices of the relative color, necessitating a Hauler-class ship is needed to pick up the spices. In Wild systems spice color is the same as the closest system with spice. You also can destroy the crates by firing at them, and then pick up the Damaged spice, which will then be added to your inventory.\nYou can also find rare spices there, e.g. ruby, gold, amethyst, which sells for a lot higher than normal spice crates.\nTrivia\nSome say that SP stands for 'Spice Problems' due to the fact that to reach the spices there may be a some enemies in your way.\nWith warship haulers, you can typically ignore the drones or make quick work of them with your Point Defense Turrets.",
