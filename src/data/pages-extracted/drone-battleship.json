  "full_text": "Drone Battleship\n\nDescription\nThe Drone Battleship is one of the strongest enemies in the game. Drone Battleships have a 10% chance to spawn after a player defeats a 5-wave Drone Fleet. They are massive capital ships that warp in flanked by an escort of up to six Elite Drone Frigates and Elite Drone Destroyers. Rather than having a single shield and hull bar, Drone Battleships have seperate hull and shield for each part of the ship. Due to their powerful escorts and high shield and hull regen, they're considered to be the most powerful and difficult NPC in the game. \nBattleship SectionsStrategiesLoot\nBattlementsShield GeneratorsCommunications ArrayMain ReactorSuper structure\nThese structures cover the main shield generators and the reactor. It is mandatory to take out these sections to expose the reactor and destroy the ship. They have cannon and beam turrets laid across them which fire at the player until the battlement (or the player) is destroyed.\nThe minimum number of battlements required to be destroyed are both of the front battlements to destroy the reactor shield generators and at least one of the central battlements to expose the reactor. However, it is highly recommended to destroy all the battlements to limit the battleship's devastating damage.\nThe Shield Generators increase the overall shield of the parts of the Battleship. The rear two shield generators are optional to destroy, but the front two shield generators are mandatory to destroy in order to damage the reactor and defeat the battleship.\nThey are essentially long wands with the palette of a power cell or a drone factory generator. They are reasonably small so they can be difficult to hit. The front 2 are covered by the front battlements and the two on the back are extremely tiny and are uncovered from the start, being on both sides of the bridge of the ship (you can see them in the image, they appear as thin, glowing white tubes).\nDestroying all of the shield generators will result in all parts of the battleship permanently losing shields.\nThis section calls in reinforcements, with mixes of Elite Drone Destroyers and Elite Drone Frigates. The Communications Array only activates once an existing reinforcement ship is destroyed. Destroying this is optional but recommended, as the reinforcements are incredibly powerful. Note that there cannot be more than 6 reinforcement ships assisting the battleship at once.\nThey appear as two small antennas on the top of the body, directly above the reactor and the center battlements.\nThe main reactor is hidden behind the central battlements. Once it is exposed and the front shield generators are destroyed, it can be damaged. When the Main Reactor is destroyed the battleship will explode and drop its loot.\nUntil the front shield generators are destroyed, the reactor will be shielded by an indestructible energy barrier regardless of whether it has been exposed.\nThis is the center part of the ship in which all parts are connected. It is crucial to note it is impossible to destroy normally due to the battleship regenerating all damage dealt to this section of the ship.\nThe entire length has turrets, but these are not as strong as the battlements. The top of the battleship holds the bridge of the battleship, and attached to it are two shield generators that are optional to destroy. Note that the bridge is still considered part of the main body and is indestructible.\nWithin the superstructure are 2 drone hangars which can launch several interceptors and fighters. These can range between Normal and Elite types, but are usually ignored due to their low firepower.\nThe best way to kill a battleship is beam/coilgun kiting with a destroyer or team of destroyers, but if destroyers are outside your price range you could try some of the other strategies. None of these are sure ways to win; you still need enough skill and sense to be flexible.\nBait and RaidRange KitingWith Destroyer\nUsing a squad of Halos with Afterburner and Phalanxes with Hull Booster, have the Phalanxes tank the Battleships aggro. By alternating which Phalanx is taking damage, the Phalanxes can survive long enough to allow the Halos to attack the Battleship without taking damage. When the Phalanxes have run out of shield and health, retreat by warping to another planet in the system. Then, once the Phalanxes have healed to full health, warp back in and continue repeating the process.\nBy using fast frigates such as the Judicator, Halo, and Adamant, along with Railgun or Beam Turrets (the longest ranged turrets), attackers can fire out of range of the Battleship (5k in-game distance for the beams, 3k for the cannons) while targeting one of the sections. This method of Range Kiting allows the frigates to take little to no damage while gradually destroying the sections of the battleship.\nUse full Blasters or Railguns and the best Hull Repairer you can get. Then, snipe the Drone Battleship from out of its detection radius. The order you should destroy the components are: Communication Relay/Array, Shield generators --> Front Battlements --> Front Shield Generators --> Middle Battlement --> Reactor. A Conciliator is preferred by many players for this method, because of its combination of top-heavy turret placement, speed, and adaptability, but any destroyer can suffice, with differing probabilities of success.\nDrone Battleships have a chance to drop Hybrid Blueprints, Hybrid Ship Blueprints, Hybrid Modules and Subsystems, Narcor and Red Narcor, Rare Ores, Common Ores, and more.\nTrivia\nUpon killing the fleet’s command ship, the remaining drones will immediately warp out and a scanner warning will appear. Boss music will start playing, and the Drone Battleship will warp in.\nWhen Drone Battleships were initially announced, most details about their strength and spawning conditions were omitted, leaving players to discover them themselves.\nThe player community has a running competition of who can use the least amount of equipment to successfully defeat a battleship. The most recent feat was using only a Stratos, which is rather difficult to top, but previous records involved multiboxing using corvettes, brawling using a destroyer, or sniping using only a single corvette.\nCurrently, the most extreme defeat of a drone battleship was performed by a player named Benjamin67832, using his Stratos to defeat the battleship without dying a single time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BsgB7TnYaY\nThe faction VYKDOM was one of the first to find one while searching for the 'new boss' with a fleet of 20 players. However, the players were unable to defeat the Battleship initially due to their lack of knowledge of how to do so. They later returned with reinforcements from the faction PEGA to destroy it with brute force.\nDrone Battleships are currently the only ship without an overall health bar, instead having individual sections with their own health bars that need to be destroyed in order to destroy the overall ship.\nIt's possible to destroy a Drone Battleship utilizing nothing but incredibly high DPS. This is due to the fact that a drone battleship will still be destroyed if the superstructure health ever reaches zero, but never happens in normal gameplay because of the virtually limitless hull regen.\nBefore Drone Cruisers were replaced with Elite Drone Destroyers, the Drone Battleship used to summon Drone Cruisers as reinforcements, making it the only place other than Drone Hideouts where Drone Cruisers could actually be found.\nDrone Battleships were considered impossible to kill with one account before the Faction Warfare update, which added destroyers. However, some players have been able to kill a Battleship using multiple accounts before the update. The first player to successfully do so was Cyka_ChickenM8.\nWhile Drone Battleships have the potential to drop incredible amounts of high-value loot, the difficulty in destroying one combined with the possibility of getting almost no loot at all deter most players from ever trying to defeat one.\nDo not underestimate the speed at which a Drone Battleship can warp in. Many people have lost their ships because they stuck around a bit too long.",
