  "full_text": "This page is dedicated to upcoming, planned and cancelled content of Starscape. There are updates done to this page when content is being actively worked on, but we can't predict or tell you what can definitely come besides the news Keth puts out. To prevent clutter, if you want more information regarding the upcoming update you can join the Starscape Discord and check out channels like #dev-blog and #roadmap!\n\nIn September 2022, ZolarKeth, the main developer, decided that he wanted Starscape to return to being a solo project developed only by himself. Most of the information on this page was planned before this event. \nIn December 2024, Keth updated the game to allow for more options with the radial menu, made probes a consumable item again and added new probes.\nAs of March 2025, Keth is working on an upcoming update that has two parts, one that focuses on improvements to AI regarding how it fights and targets ships, and the other one is faction administrators, where it distributes perms and abilities that to multiple people when it previously all were exclusive to the faction leader themself. The other part of this update is regarding region-locked resources, where there is a modifier that is visible informing you of how abundant/scarce a resource is. Additionally, we are getting two new destroyers in the form of haulers, the Andromeda(TU) and the Mantle(Syndicate). Lastly, the biggest focus of this update is proxy stations, that can only be built in colonisation zones in wild, has no cloning bay but is essentially a tamer version of player stations and a base for what is to come next.\n\nThis roadmap was announced in January 2024 when Keth returned. Keth has stated that this map is highly subject to change.\n\nInsurance Is Bad\n- Rework insurance system to make losses meaningful and remove resources from the economy\n- Probably a combination of base insurance level, upgrade packages, and resource reimbursements\nPlanets Remastered\n- Aurorae, city lights, population statistics, new textures\n- I like shiny things\nGroup Warps\n- Command your squad to warp at the same time, travel in the same bubble, and exit warp together\nThe Probe Update*\n- Make probes items again and add some form of combat probe\n*As of March 2025, probes are now items but combat probes have yet to come out/been worked on.\nGet Dressed\n- Add layered clothing\n- New cosmetics in the stardust shop\nShip Combat Overhaul (Let's Try This Again)\n- Change hull to not be regenerable via modules but allow for more effective passive tank than shields\n- Change shields to not have deflection and be a more effective active tank than hull\n- Rebalance ship stats again\n- Add/remove/rebalance modules as needed\n- Maybe logistics turrets or something\nMake The Tutorial A Little Better (~1 week)\n- I will probably deprioritize this because I find it so utterly boring to work on\nCrouching?\n- I dunno, maybe, if I feel like it\nRemodel space stations\n- Merge residential stations into other station types\n- Create larger station centers\n- Revamp station interiors\n- Allow factions to rent office space\n- More interesting NPC behavior?\nGalactic Geography\n- New cluster-based galaxy map\n- Change ship/item storage and player market to be per-cluster\n- New resources, modify resource distribution, new mining mechanics\n- New POIs and anomalies\nTBA\nGalaxy At War II\n- Improvements to faction warfare\nTBA\nThis section was copied from the Starscape discord, hence explaining the first-person text.\nCURRENT STATUS:\nKeth has announced a fairly big update that is coming soon to Starscape, this is a more detailed one from the one summarized above.\nImprovements to NPC AI\nTargetting Behaviour : NPC AI behaviour regarding fighting is being changed by an extensive rewrite of its code and targetting algorithm. This will essentially allow a NPC ship to divide its firepower by attacking multiple ships simultaneously and create more interesting and engaging fights. They are also being designed to take into consideration factors like turret direction, turn rate, turret range and a few more things to make fights less mundane.\nHostility Chaining : What this means is that when you try to fight off a specific NPC ship from a fleet, instead of it just attacking you, this will aggravate/signal the other ships in the fleet to attack you as well, making you have to fight them all at once. Larger classes of ships like cruisers and battleships also now have increased engagement ranges, so you won't see a battleship sitting 2.5km away from hostile ships and doing nothing. Battleship turn rates have also been doubled so they are more useful and less likely to just fly off into the sunset.\nFaction administrators.\nPreviously, the owner of a faction is the one who has permissions and the ability to do a bunch of tasks affecting the faction such as recruiting, withdrawing money from the treasury, making announcements, etc. Now there will be dedicated roles that members of factions can be assigned so that it doesn't create a \"bottleneck\" where its just the owner having all the power.\nAsteroid Improvements and Server Information\nAsteroids are receiving an optimization and aesthetic overhaul. Firstly, they are estimated to use 50% less network data which is expected to improve server join time and ensuring stability of servers with many people.\nAsteroids will no longer use the low-res textures it had since the days of early alpha, now using PBR textures to get the visuals to match the higher quality visuals the game is moving on forward with(detailed ship models, structures etc.)\nWith Roblox's recent UI update, some parts of the UI covers the server information, and Keth shifted it to the right to ensure visibility.\nRegional resource distribution\nThis update concerns the availability of certain resources based on the region. Certain regions will have more abundant or scarcer amounts of specific resources. This is to create competition for resources where its more abundant and basically creates an opportunity to pirate and actually fight over for it. However, just because one resource is more abundant/scarce, DOES NOT affect the spawn rate of other resources! Additionally this will affect spawn rates of anomalies dedicated to resources. (E.g Comet Anomalies are less likely to spawn in regions where water ice is scarce)\nThe main goal of this update is to make wild systems have more variety as all wild systems right now have the same chance to spawn anomalies, abberations etc. Several other details can be found in the Starscape Discord, but the images shown is subject to change and is only an example for showcasing it. Lastly, Keth has said that VX spawn rates and modifiers will not be touched possibly due to its already rare nature.\nNew Destroyer-Haulers\nPreviously the biggest haulers were the Galaxy and Shroud frigates. The game has destroyer-haulers but only NPC factions have it as vendor ships to purchase items from when you encounter them. This update will make those accessible to players!\nThe first destroyer is the Andromeda from the Trade Union. Like other Trade Union ships, this hauler is focused primarily on maximizing cargo crates, as evident by multiple crates on it. As usual it is going to very slow and less fast when escaping out from threats. When used properly, this is expected to give significantly more profit for hauling runs. In the TU ship-line, its predecessor is the Galaxy-class Frigate Hauler.\nThe second destroyer is the Mantle from the Syndicate. Like other Syndicate ships, this hauler is focused primarily on stealth and speed as its crates are hidden under near the belly area. It will be faster than the Galaxy and its warp charge time will be somewhat higher. As usual the nature of its stealth-focus causes it to have less crates than the Andromeda but will still be profitable. In the Syndicate ship-line, its predecessor is the Shroud-class Frigate Hauler.\n\nThe following are updates that were planned to come eventually, but should not be expected anytime soon.\n\nBombers will be introduced to counter the ever increasing size of ships with their damaging armament\nMissiles and \"support ships\" will also be added. Support ships will have abilities to boost ships around them.\n\nFaction warfare will be cleaned up, and will have ceasefire states, rewards for winning, and a leaderboard introduced.\n\nThe next ship classes to be added to the game for players are Cruisers, then Battlecruisers, and then Battleships. Battlecruisers will be a class between cruisers and battleships. The following models are outdated, but were potential candidates.\nThese ships will not be added anytime soon. There is no reason for players to need massive ships like this right now, because very few NPCs stand in our way as it is.\n\nThe following are updates that have been partially worked on but will not be released in the near future, if at all, due to limitations or circumstances.\n\nPoliced systems would have been between Secure and Unsecure space, and would have had police ships patrolling the system. There would be a Wanted Level system, where players causing more problems will have more action taken against them. This was cancelled due to complications with design, as well as being a \"solution looking for a problem.\"\n\nVery similar to Solo Stations but there would be less modular expansion. They would have their own storage system, unconnected to CoreSec Storage. Their invulnerability shields would be powered by Fuel, a new cargo type created using Deuterium, also known as heavy water, a type of resource obtained from refining Ice. When the station's fuel runs out, the shield goes down, and the station would become vulnerable to other players and will eventually be destroyed on its own.\n\n \nThese stations would have been given to every player upon completion of the tutorial. They would exist in private orbits around a planet, and players could pay to move them. They would have been connected to CoreSec storage. Their core function would be NPCs coming and paying you to live on your station. They would require a constant supply of Fuel and food to retain renters. Levels would include agricultural, residential, market, reactor, command, and executive.\nSolo Stations Reveal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZoh2-d\n \n\nFaction stations would have had some sort of module customization. Bases would require fuel to maintain its functions. The amount needed will increase depending on the size of the station and the modules it has. There would have been trading mechanics between faction stations.\n\n \nZolarKeth worked on them early in the game's development, but because of the massive load-in times and general lack of optimization of Roblox servers, they were discontinued until further notice. Planetary landings would use the same system that rings have currently, where players would be able to find specific points of interests that they would be able to lightburn to. These POIs would be around 10k x 10k in size for players to roam around in. \n \n↑ File:Planets1.png\n↑ File:Planets.png",
