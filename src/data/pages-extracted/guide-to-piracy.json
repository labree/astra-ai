  "full_text": "Guide to Piracy\nPiracy is a form of PVP, in where a combat ship actively searches for industrial ships to kill and loot. This guide will go over the act, and give tips to both sides.\nQuick Tips for Pirates\nPiracy is deceptively hard to get into. Your target may escape, fight back, or even kill you. These tips will hopefully limit your target's options, allowing for an easier kill.\n- Use a disruptor. While it may seem very obvious, warp disruptors are crucial in keeping your target where you want them.\n- Pirate in pairs. Having multiple people around allows for significantly easier kills.\n- Use a fast ship. Anything above a corvette will be too slow to catch up to a target before it warps out.\n- Don't underestimate your targets. Many people will equip turrets on their ships, which can easily kill a careless fighter-pirate.\n- Warp charge time is irrelevant- if your target got into interstellar warp, they can simply warp log to escape. Instead, focus on interplanetary speed (e.g., Warp Amplifiers) to intercept targets before they can escape.\nHow to Avoid a Pirate\nPiracy, while fun to the offender, is quite poor of an experience to the victim. That being said, here's everything you can do to make the kill as hard as possible.\n- Scout ahead with an alt. The best way to escape a pirate is to avoid them altogether. If you're willing to deal with the extra hassle, this method will make sure you never encounter another pirate.\n- Have a Lightburner equipped. Lightburners are extremely valuable, letting you launch ahead out of a disruptor's range. Since the disruptor also has a cooldown, you can freely escape while the pirate malds, (fails to) cope, and seethe.\n- Avoid hotspots. This will be learned naturally, but just avoid places that are known to be crawling with pirates. Gatinsir, Emas, Cid Tapa and Eod'taost are such places. A spinoff of this idea is to avoid areas where you've died to a pirate more than 2 times. After all, “Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Thrice is a pattern.”\n- Use common sense. Don't trust anyone, especially not in the harsh reality of Starscape. Don't follow people who aren't your ally, and do your best to avoid unnecessary risks.",
