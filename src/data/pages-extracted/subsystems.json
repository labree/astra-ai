  "full_text": "Subsystems\nSubsystems are a modification obtainable via crafting and salvaging destroyed ships. They are used to customize and enhance player ships. Subsystems provide a special effect when activated at the cost of energy. All subsystems are considered as \"active\" modules, as they are triggered manually by the player. To use a subsystem, press the number that corresponds with the subsystem slot at the bottom of the screen.\nSubsystem Types\nSubsystems are found in four forms: \nUniversal, equipped on any ship regardless of size (e.g. Overclocker, Hull/ Shield Booster, etc.)\nSmall, equipped on fighter-sized ships (e.g. Light Hull Repairer, Blink Drive, etc.)\nMedium, equipped on corvette and frigate-sized ships (e.g. Medium Shield Repairer, Lightburner-M, etc.)\nLarge, equipped on destroyer-sized ships(Heavy Hull Repairer, Overdrive-L, etc.).\nYou can still use small/medium/large repairer subsystems on any type of ship, but you can't use certain subsystems like lightburners and overdrives for different classes of ships, they have to be for that class. The energy usage and (for repairers)amount of hp given scales with their size (Repairer-L uses more energy than Repairer-M). \nSubsystems can change the course of a battle, but they can't win a battle by themselves. It entirely depends on how and when the player uses them.\nTheir strength is based on their item tier. For a comprehensive guide on how to determine item tier, visit the classification page.\nUniversal\n\nDisruptor\nA tier III Disruptor in storage.\nThe Disruptor disrupts a players warp, loved by many pirates as they help them keep their victims where they want them to be. Disruptors cannot be used in contested systems.\nThis subsystem comes in 4 tiers. Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Hybrid / Dread.\nEffect Table (Disruptor)\nTier\nEnergy Regeneration (Active)\nActivation Energy\nCooldown\nEnergy Consumption (MJ/s)\nRange\nI\n-90%\n10\n12.5\n3\n1500m\nII\n2.5\n1750m\nIII\n2\n2000m\nX (Hybrid/Dread)\n1.5\n2250m\nLightburner\nA tier III Lightburner in storage.\nThe lightburner is a Hallmark of a PVP setup for a pilot who runs from fights or a pirate who never lets one ship escape. The lightburner is special in that, unlike any other subsystem, it can quickly warp a ship 4km to 6km (depending on the quality, or tier, of the lightburner) ahead of where it is facing.\nUnlike every other subsystem, this subsystem comes in only two tiers: Tier 3 and Ancient Tier. It also has 3 sizes: small, medium, and large.\nBesides this, tier 3 can only be bought with Lp from The Syndicate with a high enough standing, and ancient tier can only be found and looted at X-Structures for a low chance, and intact Ancient Stations for a much higher chance.\nEffect Table (Lightburner)\nTier (Size)\nLightburn Distance\nActivation Energy\nCooldown\nCharge Time\nIII (Light)\n4000m\n55\n150s\n3s\nIII (Medium)\n150\nIII (Heavy)\n500\nX (Light)\n6000m\n55\nX (Medium)\n150\nX (Heavy)\n500\nEnergy Booster\nA Tier III Energy Booster in the player's inventory.\nThe Energy Booster, hence the name, boosts your energy.
