  "full_text": "Mining\nMining is the process by which you extract ores from an asteroid, then refine them into Materials for crafting or sale. The basic concept is taught in the in game tutorial - shoot a rock, and smaller rocks fly off, which you can collect by ramming the smaller rocks with your ship. However, the in-game tutorial perhaps doesn't cover the best ways to mine, and as such, those will be explained below.\nMining Hardpoints\nMining hardpoints are customizable hardpoints on fighter-style miners such as the Badger. There are currently two types of mining hardpoints - Detonator hardpoints and Laser hardpoints.\nDetonator hardpoints fire an exploding projectile towards the player's cursor, releasing ore that needs to be picked up through collision or tractor beams when impacting an asteroid. This is the default hardpoint on all fighter-style miners.\nLaser hardpoints emit a concentrated beam of light towards the locked asteroid, sucking in ore to the mining ship through the laser and releasing much fewer excess ore that needs to be gathered around the asteroid compared to the detonator. While similar in appearance to a mining turret, it is not as efficient.\nMining Turrets\nMining turrets are turrets that can be placed on turret hardpoints on warships. These turrets offer a great increase to mining rate as well as options for specialization and benefits from bonuses on mining warships. Currently, mining turrets are all of Small (S) size. For an in-depth overview of mining turret statistics, go to the turret page.\nMiner turrets are the default mining turret, firing a concentrated beam of light that works similarly to the Laser hardpoint. This is unarguably less efficient than the specialized versions of Miner turrets but is cheap and can be bought from NPC marketplaces.\nStrip Miner turrets are an upgraded variant of the Miner turret, sacrificing the capture ratio of the asteroid but increasing mining rate greatly. This makes it useful for active mining playstyles. The higher tier of this turret requires a blueprint from the Mining Guild.\nPrecision Miner turrets are an upgraded variant of the Miner turret, sacrificing mining rate when compared to strip miners but increasing the capture ratio. This makes it useful for more casual or AFK mining playstyles. The higher tier of this turret requires a blueprint from the Mining Guild.\nIce Miner turrets are an upgraded variant of the Miner turret, sacrificing mining rate compared to the other upgraded miner turrets but having greatly increased effectiveness on ice cores. This makes it useful for harvesting ice, but not much else. The higher tier of this turret requires a blueprint from the Mining Guild.\nMining PDTs\nMost PDT turrets, or \"P\" turrets as referred to the game, are used for self-defense - however, mining ships will find it useful to equip mining-oriented PDTs to improve the mining experience. As of current, there is only one mining-focused PDT, the Tractor turret.\nTractor PDTs allow players to fire a blue beam of light that sucks in ore towards the origin point. This tractor beam can be fired manually using the designated key, or automatically by pressing \"F\" to enable tractor lock on a piece of floating ore.\nMaterials\n \nMain Article: Materials\nThe game has 8 materials total, which can be broadly placed into 3 categories: common, rare and guarded ores.\nCommon Ores such as Korrelite, Reknite, and Gellium have 4 \"grades.‚Äù These tend to be used in bulk for nearly everything in the game, and can be found at lower qualities in secure and unsecure systems, and in higher qualities in wild systems. Quality does not affect the material itself, just the amount of the material you can refine from the ore.\nRare Ores such as Axnit, Water, Narcor (Blucor), and Red Narcor (Redcor) have only 1 or 2 \"grades\", but tend to be much more expensive per unit than Common Ores. Axnit can be found rarely in anomalies in secure systems, and both narcor variants can be found rarely in unsecure system anomalies, but these ores are almost always found in wild systems. Water is exclusive to CM Anomalies, which can be found in all security types. However, mining with regular mining equipment will lose a significant portion of the ore. Ice Miner turrets are required for efficient extraction.\nGuarded Ores can't be mined without fighting a powerful opponent. Currently, Vexnium is the only guarded ore. It can only be found in VX anomalies, and upon activating the VX anomaly, 2 - 5 \"???\" enemies appear with high damage, lightning projectile weapons. Once these are defeated, the Vexnium (found by mining the yellow ores within a VX anomaly) can be safely mined.\nNote that Superior and Pristine spawn rates increase with the security status of the system. The more dangerous the system is, the better the ores, with Anomalies granting mostly Superior and Pristine common ores and all ore types around the far reaches of wild.\nGrade Chart\nInferior\nRegular\nSuperior\nPristine\nKorrelite\n1\n2\n3\n4\nReknite\n1\n2\n3\n4\nGellium\n1\n2\n3\n4\nAxnit\n1\n2\nWater\n1\nNarcor\n1\nRed Narcor\n1\nVexnium\n1\nAnomalies\nMain Article: Anomalies\nAnomalies are hidden warp locations you can visit once you discover them, usually through launching your Personal Probe which is a multi-use function on your ship, which was introduced in the Next Gen update (before the Next Gen update, probes had to be purchased or manufactured to use). They tend to house benefits you can loot and mine, and can be found all over Wild, Unsecure, Contested, and sometimes Secure with FOs being exclusive to Wild. \nNOTE: THIS PAGE ONLY CONTAINS ANOMALIES WHICH CONTAIN ASTEROIDS. SEE Anomalies FOR MORE INFORMATION.\nAT Anomalies, which contain a small number of random asteroids of all ore types and grades. Can spawn up to Red Narcor in wild space.\nAL Anomalies, which are identical to AT anomalies except they are much larger.\nMT Anomalies, which contain a tier 3 Monument. Most also have a massive ring of pristine quality asteroids around the monument - either of Korrelite, Reknite or Gellium. An untouched monument will always be surrounded by a ring of 24 asteroids each dropping 25 pristine ore, which means ~600 ore, which refines to 2400 Korrelite, Reknite, or Gellium in total.\nFO Anomalies, which contain some regular Korrelite, but not much in terms of ores. They have a shop in which you can purchase powerful items for extremely cheap prices. As long as you have decent Syndicate standing, these places will be safe from NPCs, FO Anomalies tend to hold furniture, low and mid tier modules and turrets, and weapons.\nWH Anomalies: Wormholes, which may lead to other systems with better anomalies, such as deeper wild space. New players are recommended to stay away from these due to WH campers. These are useful for bypassing pirate-heavy Unsecure Systems for depositing your ores in your storage.\nAA Anomalies, which are around the same size as AT anomalies except they only contain regular and pristine Axnit asteroids.\nAN Anomalies, which are around the same size as AT anomalies except they only contain Narcor and Red Narcor.\nCM Anomalies, which is a large comet with a trail filled with water ice cores, which require Ice Miners in order to mine at maximum efficency.\nVX Anomalies, which have Vexnium. Vexnium can only be mined with mining turrets, and are protected by ???s, which will remain in their dormant state (a large crystal-like structure) until a Vexnium asteroid is mined. See Anomaly:VX for more information. \nIdeal Mining Strategies\n \nThe most obvious strategy would be to just mine; after all, there are ores in every system, why not mine that? \nThis is called Safe Mining, Mining in systems closer to The Citadel means you get lower quality ores, and your time, compared to what you could be doing, is relatively wasted. It does have the advantage that if you need to do something that isn't mining, that Citadel is right around the corner, but expect a lower income.\nHowever, if your goal is the mass-production of cheap burgers, and you have time to burn, then Safe Mining can work well. Many players Wild Mine for rare resources, and Safe Mine for the massive amounts of common resources required.\n\"Well, if I go farther into unsecured and wild, there will be more pirates! I don't wanna be pirated! And the drones are OP and pirate dens are literal hell!1!!1\"\nNot entirely true. There are two enemies in this game you have to deal with:\nNPCs - Drones, NPC Pirates, and other such obstacles. These have the benefit that if you warp into a system with them, they will ignore you for just about 5-7 seconds, or until you shoot. This means that if you keep warping around, NPCs will never notice you and you can do whatever you want. As such, these are not really an issue as long as you are engaged in warping, and once you are ready to mine, simply find a planet or Anomaly without these.\nNote: If you accidentally aggro an NPC, rejoin immediately. This resets their \"hostile\" state, and will allow you to warp out of the warp hub safely.\nIn order to minimize the amount of damage you take, choose 2 planets that are the farthest apart from each other, and launch a probe just before you engage warp. This will prevent NPCs from attacking you while you're busy looking for anomalies. \nPlayers - These are much more dangerous. They can stop your warp, trick you, and will generally try and ruin your day. While many are just as scared as you are, others are... more malicious in their intentions. However, most players usually refrain from going into the deeper Wild sections, and with that; the farther out you go, the chance of finding a player drops spectacularly, to the point that past the first few rings of Wild systems, you'll almost never encounter another player.\nThe further out you go, the less Players you have to deal with, and the more NPCs. This can be dangerous for players who aren't paying attention, but for everyone else, it is an avoidable catastrophe. It is recommended to refrain from using ships that you cannot easily replace and opt to use a ship such as the Honey Badger, however, higher risk, higher reward in these cases.\nPerhaps you want an in-between. The profit of wild systems for the safety of secure. Well, that's what Contested Mining is for. \nThe loot tables of contested anomalies are considerably lower than that of wild systems though you can still get good anomalies like AA's and aberrations found in planet ring deposits. And, if you are in a military, your factions contested systems are likely only going to have neutral players and members of your military, significantly lowering the number of hostile players (unless you are at a faction border, in which case the danger is very high due to invading warships). Also, your military's HQ is right around the corner, and if anyone attacks you, they will have to deal with A) hostile NPCs/players, which can overwhelm even the most experienced of pilots, or B) attempting to pirate you while being unable to warp disrupt you, making contested mining a great alternative if you just need a bit of Axnit or Gellium. \nThe best strategy for Miners who are trying to get the most profit is Deep Space Anomaly Mining. \nChoose a point in Wild Space. Any will do, however, the deeper into Wild space you venture, the better the quality of anomalies and ores, at the cost of a higher risk. Turn on \"Safe Route\" and set it as your destination. Choose Wild space that is near your faction's contested systems if you are enlisted in one. If you are neutral, then it doesn't matter.\nSafe Route is not necessarily required, but many have lost ships because of the pathfinding system routing them through a pirate hotspot, and they didn't take notice or just didn't know. Generally being in Secure for as long as possible before passing into Unsecure is ideal (or in the case of Ves-Ialk/Vlasium, you can go straight from Secure to Wild, although some pirates may frequent the systems, so be careful when going through).\nA usually done strategy is to store everything before you go, and to fly in a Stratos or a fighter to the farthest point, without having to fly along Secure. Then, at the farthest station at the edge of Unsecure space, you switch out to your ship which you wish to use.\nAnother common strategy is scouting for a Wormhole in secure systems that lead to the wild, use a ship with fast warp charge such as a Stratos or Paragon, do note however that wormholes near common routes and the Citadel have a higher chance of getting camped. You can also try finding wormholes in contested systems that aren't near the Contested/Unsecure-Wild border due to a high presence of pirates.\nYou'll need three things: Credits (for buying at FO Anomalies or from NPC/Player vendors, though this is optional), a purpose (So you know what to mine), and a mining ship.\nOnce these are ready, start warping quickly to your location. This may take a while, but don't look away for too long. Your ship can be annihilated in an instant if you aren't careful.\nOnce out in far wild, find a place without drones, deploy a probe, and look for mining anomalies listed in Anomalies. Start mining, and try and find the materials you need for a ship.\nThere are advanced ways of doing this, such as deploying a probe in a planet and then warping to another planet as your probe explores, or just flying away from the enemies when you enter your desired system, but it's less stressful just to find a planet without drones.\nRepeat as necessary until you either run out of cargo space or you have found everything you need. Then, set a course for the closest Contested sector (Unsecure works too, but be careful so as not to get blown to pieces by player pirates the moment you warp in), and start warping.\nFind a station, despawn your ship, and deposit all of your goods into storage, and perform any other tasks needed such as refining ores (however, this is optional if you want to reset or do so another time).\nReset, if you want to teleport back to the Citadel with all of your yields in your storage, or head back out.\nA modification of this strategy which is better suited for Fighter Miners is Deep Space Rare Ore Mining, commonly known as cherry-picking among the community. \nInstead of mining what you need, mine solely Axnit, Narcor and Red Narcor. These are worth the most for your time, and you can sell them to players to then buy all the materials you need. This potentially takes less time, but will require more patience, and for you to be as far out from Citadel as possible.\nOther, far less rare resources can be mined in systems such as Contested systems, as they can pose a far less risk to you rather than deep space mining, and generally have similar qualities of the lower-rarity resources that would otherwise be found in Wild or Unsecure space, the highest concentration of these resources is often found in Planet ring deposits.\nAnother modification of this strategy for Warship Miners is Deep Space Bulk Mining. \nInstead of mining what you need, just mine everything! Literally, everything! You should be clearing AT and AL clusters with this strategy, along with MTs.\nThis is best utilized with AFK Mining, assuming you are in very deep wild. Don't be completely AFK unless you are willing to lose your ship to a random player pirate. Check on your ship often.\nAnother modification of this strategy involves Wormholes, this can apply for any suitable mining ship.\nThis process is similar to the above-mentioned methods; however, you'll need to find an above-mentioned wormhole that leads to Wild space. Any will do, just ensure the wormhole isn't highly trafficked to minimize the risk of danger to yourself and to ensure that on your trip you have a better chance of finding the items or resources you need. Aside from mining, there are other anomalies that are generally worth the time to visit. These include but are not limited to: X-Structures, Frontier Outposts, Aberrations, etc.\nFor those looking for lots of guaranteed ore and to do missions at the same time, Mission mining is another viable option. If you choose a \"Office Supply Run\" mission and go to the system the supplies are, you will find that along with the possible resource abberations that may be in the system, you will also get a large field of ores with the outpost in the middle of it. The strategy for this is to first mine all the asteroids outside the mission, then mine the Mission's resources.\nAFK Mining\nWhile it is impossible to get the game to mine for you (without using bots or hacks), it is possible to make it require minimal input using Warship Miners.\nFirstly, you should know that if you aim at something, turrets aim at max range, directly at where you have aimed. As such, if you aim behind a target, you can line it up so only 1 beam locks onto an asteroid. Doing this for all your turrets means you on average triple or quadruple the amount of time between your turrets needing a new target.\nSecondly, understand that not every ore matters. You don't need to collect it all to still make tons of money. Don't equip a tractor beam, you probably won't need it. You yield 90%(100% if max skill on precision mining) of the ores with tier 2 Precision Miners, and while you may show symptoms of anxiety at first as the loose ore floats away, you will get used to it.\nFinally, you can perform a small glitch with the game, where if you hold down the fire key for a turret or weapon, press escape or enter a menu, and then let go, your turrets will fire continuously. Doing this with miners mean they will fire at where you point, and lock onto something if the vector collides with an asteroid. If you lock all your miners, then look at another, all the miners (when they are done) will go over to that asteroid, and start mining it.\nAlways use Precision Miners in AFK mining, as this is what they were designed for.\nWith all these factors, you should be able to, with minimal input, remove entire AT clusters from existence with maybe 3 minutes total of looking at the Roblox screen, over the course of ~30 minutes of work.\nBe careful. If a player warps in and finds you AFK, they will HAPPILY kill you and take all your profits.\nTips & Tricks\nWhen in unsecure and wild systems, always keep an eye on the player list. You can always check if someone's popped into the system, or if you're all alone and free to mine. If someone comes in, it is suggested to leave the system immediately. Losing an anomaly to another player is a lot better than losing your ship and all your inventory.\nOther strategies include flying far from the place in which players warp in. If you are far enough, you won't get noticed as the player warps in and looks around. If you are noticed, warp to the next sector or to the nearest planet, and then to the nearest sector.\nYou can also just warp out upon seeing someone, and warplog when you see the black screen indicating you are transitioning servers, or if you are in an aberration or an anomaly, safelog.\nWhile materials can be sold to NPCs, never, ever do that, as there is always player demand for them. You will get much more money selling it to players. Ores can be sold to other players using vendor ships or the player marketplace which can be access via the market terminal.\nMining in basic warships is very inefficient and slow compared to mining warships, due to their not having a mining buff.\nPiracy is bound to happen. As such, make sure that something you are taking into wild can be replaced. This means using a cheaper mining ship if that is something that is easily replaceable. If, say, replacing an Ozark is not an option, it would be smarter to mine in something cheaper, like a Honey Badger.\nFor an advanced guide on AFK Mining and Multibox Mining, check out the Multibox page.\nFor a full guide on the mining basics, what ships to use and upgrades to pair with these ships, general tips and tricks, visit this guide.",

Then, set a course for the closest Contested sector (Unsecure works too, but be careful so as not to get blown to pieces by player pirates the moment you warp in), and start warping.\nFind a station, despawn your ship, and deposit all of your goods into storage, and perform any other tasks needed such as refining ores (however, this is optional if you want to reset or do so another time).\nReset, if you want to teleport back to the Citadel with all of your yields in your storage, or head back out.\nA modification of this strategy which is better suited for Fighter Miners is Deep Space Rare Ore Mining, commonly known as cherry-picking among the community. \nInstead of mining what you need, mine solely Axnit, Narcor and Red Narcor. These are worth the most for your time, and you can sell them to players to then buy all the materials you need. This potentially takes less time, but will require more patience, and for you to be as far out from Citadel as possible.\nOther, far less rare resources can be mined in systems such as Contested systems, as they can pose a far less risk to you rather than deep space mining, and generally have similar qualities of the lower-rarity resources that would otherwise be found in Wild or Unsecure space, the highest concentration of these resources is often found in Planet ring deposits.\nAnother modification of this strategy for Warship Miners is Deep Space Bulk Mining. \nInstead of mining what you need, just mine everything! Literally, everything! You should be clearing AT and AL clusters with this strategy, along with MTs.\nThis is best utilized with AFK Mining, assuming you are in very deep wild. Don't be completely AFK unless you are willing to lose your ship to a random player pirate. Check on your ship often.\nAnother modification of this strategy involves Wormholes, this can apply for any suitable mining ship.\nThis process is similar to the above-mentioned methods; however, you'll need to find an above-mentioned wormhole that leads to Wild space. Any will do, just ensure the wormhole isn't highly trafficked to minimize the risk of danger to yourself and to ensure that on your trip you have a better chance of finding the items or resources you need. Aside from mining, there are other anomalies that are generally worth the time to visit. These include but are not limited to: X-Structures, Frontier Outposts, Aberrations, etc.\nFor those looking for lots of guaranteed ore and to do missions at the same time, Mission mining is another viable option. If you choose a \"Office Supply Run\" mission and go to the system the supplies are, you will find that along with the possible resource abberations that may be in the system, you will also get a large field of ores with the outpost in the middle of it. The strategy for this is to first mine all the asteroids outside the mission, then mine the Mission's resources."

        "content": "While it is impossible to get the game to mine for you (without using bots or hacks), it is possible to make it require minimal input using Warship Miners.\nFirstly, you should know that if you aim at something, turrets aim at max range, directly at where you have aimed. As such, if you aim behind a target, you can line it up so only 1 beam locks onto an asteroid. Doing this for all your turrets means you on average triple or quadruple the amount of time between your turrets needing a new target.\nSecondly, understand that not every ore matters. You don't need to collect it all to still make tons of money. Don't equip a tractor beam, you probably won't need it. You yield 90%(100% if max skill on precision mining) of the ores with tier 2 Precision Miners, and while you may show symptoms of anxiety at first as the loose ore floats away, you will get used to it.\nFinally, you can perform a small glitch with the game, where if you hold down the fire key for a turret or weapon, press escape or enter a menu, and then let go, your turrets will fire continuously. Doing this with miners mean they will fire at where you point, and lock onto something if the vector collides with an asteroid. If you lock all your miners, then look at another, all the miners (when they are done) will go over to that asteroid, and start mining it.\nAlways use Precision Miners in AFK mining, as this is what they were designed for.\nWith all these factors, you should be able to, with minimal input, remove entire AT clusters from existence with maybe 3 minutes total of looking at the Roblox screen, over the course of ~30 minutes of work.\nBe careful. If a player warps in and finds you AFK, they will HAPPILY kill you and take all your profits."

        "content": "When in unsecure and wild systems, always keep an eye on the player list. You can always check if someone's popped into the system, or if you're all alone and free to mine. If someone comes in, it is suggested to leave the system immediately. Losing an anomaly to another player is a lot better than losing your ship and all your inventory.\nOther strategies include flying far from the place in which players warp in. If you are far enough, you won't get noticed as the player warps in and looks around. If you are noticed, warp to the next sector or to the nearest planet, and then to the nearest sector.\nYou can also just warp out upon seeing someone, and warplog when you see the black screen indicating you are transitioning servers, or if you are in an aberration or an anomaly, safelog.\nWhile materials can be sold to NPCs, never, ever do that, as there is always player demand for them. You will get much more money selling it to players. Ores can be sold to other players using vendor ships or the player marketplace which can be access via the market terminal.\nMining in basic warships is very inefficient and slow compared to mining warships, due to their not having a mining buff.\nPiracy is bound to happen. As such, make sure that something you are taking into wild can be replaced. This means using a cheaper mining ship if that is something that is easily replaceable. If, say, replacing an Ozark is not an option, it would be smarter to mine in something cheaper, like a Honey Badger.\nFor an advanced guide on AFK Mining and Multibox Mining, check out the Multibox page.\nFor a full guide on the mining basics, what ships to use and upgrades to pair with these ships, general tips and tricks, visit this guide."
