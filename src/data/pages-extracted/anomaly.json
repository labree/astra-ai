  "full_text": "Anomaly\nThis article is about system anomalies. For the category, see Category:Anomalies. For the article about planetary Aberrations, see Aberrations.\nAn anomaly is a hidden point of interest that can be found anywhere except in Core systems. They can be found by scanning with a system probe. When found, they are marked in the system map and the quick-warp menu by red target circles. Anomalies do not regenerate their contents and despawn after a few days, with new ones spawning to replace them.\nAfter an anomaly is fully mined/destroyed, it becomes deadspace and disappears when all players inside it warp away/leave the game.\nTypes\nAn anomaly name has two letters to indicate its type, followed by three random digits (for example, AL-792).\nDepending on the type, anomalies provide mining, hauling, and PvE combat opportunities. Those in systems far from the Core are likely to have better loot, higher-quality materials, and stronger enemies.\nAbbreviation\nDescription\nPage\nRarity\nSpawns in\nHostiles\nAT\nA small asteroid field, which usually contains higher quality ore and rarer materials compared other parts of the system.\nAnomaly:AT\nCommon\nAll except Core\nNone\nBF\nA battlefield of wrecked ships with storage crates, often guarded by drones.\nAnomaly:BF\nCommon\nAll except Core\nUsually fighters and corvettes, but destroyers can spawn.\nAL\nA larger variation of AT.\nAnomaly:AL\nUncommon\nAll except Core\nNone\nCM\nA large comet with ice asteroids in its trail.\nAnomaly:CM\nUncommon\nAll except Core\nNone\nDH\nA Drone Hideout containing drone structures and many drones.\nAnomaly:DH\nUncommon\nAll except Core\nUsually fighters and corvettes, but cruisers can spawn.\nSP\nA wrecked spice platform guarded by a few drones. Spice crates can be found here. If a player is in a hauler, they can haul and sell the spice elsewhere. Otherwise they can destroy them for Damaged Spice items.\nAnomaly:SP\nUncommon\nAll except Core\nUsually fighters and corvettes, but destroyers can spawn.\nMT\nA Tier 3 Monument, surrounded by a ring of pristine Korrelite, Reknite, or Gellium.\nMonuments\nUncommon\nAll except Core\nNone\nWH\nWormhole. Links to a WH in another system. This anomaly has 2 variants: transient ones last 48 hours; rarer enduring wormholes last 2 weeks.

Hibernating Crystalline Guardian ships will awaken and attack when it is mined. A mining beam is required to mine vexnium.\nAnomaly:VX\nVery Rare\nWild\nDormant guardians that will attack any player once an ore is mined.\nStrategies\nThere are 2 strategies of anomaly hunting for beginners. The most important fact to consider is that NPCs have a 4-7 second delay between you warping in and them noticing you and attacking. During this time, you can launch a probe and warp out. And if there is another player in the server, it is highly recommended to leave ASAP, destroyed ships in wild systems cannot be salvaged and will be lost forever.\nContested System Anomaly Hunting\nContested Systems have the lootpools of Unsecure systems while lacking Warp Disruption making them an attractive location for novice anomaly hunters to search.\nTo correctly and safely look for anomalies in Contested Systems, first enlist in a military faction that has a number of contested systems relatively far from the front lines. Doing this will make you immune, while in Contested space, to the approximate 30% of other Starscape players who have also enlisted in this faction. Next, go to a Contested system, preferably a stronghold, and go to the HQ planet. Once inside the invulnerability bubble, launch a system probe, and search away!\nBe aware that unaligned and enemy aligned players can still kill you, despite the lack of warp disruption.\nWild System Probing\nThis strategy is significantly more dangerous, but also far more profitable. \nFirst, go to a wild system. Using a secure WH Anomaly (Wormhole) is usually the best way to get to wilds, since you can avoid the dangers of Unsecure space, but if you can safely get through Unsecure or Contested space to Wilds, that works as well. Try to avoid close-wilds (wild systems closer to the Core) and instead go to mid-wilds and edge-wilds. Though all wild systems have identical spawnrates, there are more players in close-wilds and so there will be fewer unlooted anomalies.\nOnce in wilds, the most difficult part begins. As you warp in to the system, use the System Map (by pushing N) to determine what planet you are warping towards and what planet is farthest from that planet. Wild Warp Hubs are often full of drones or NPC Pirates. Upon warping in, you have around 5-7 seconds before they notice you. In this time, you need to hold Ctrl or Z to open the probing menu, hold click on the system probe option, launch a system probe, release click, and then release Ctrl or Z. If you are still holding click when the probing menu closes, your ship will begin shooting, which will instantly aggro all enemy NPCs in the area. As the probe launches. use the Quick Warp Menu to start warping to the planet you decided was farthest from the one you initially warped to. Use the Probing Map as you warp (the N map, which opens automatically upon launching a probe), and locate safe anomalies, such as AT or FO, that you could finish scanning at. If you reach the distant planet before locating any safe anomalies, then quickly close the N map and warp back. As your ship aligns, open the N map again and continue probing.\nOnce all anomalies have been scanned, go to the ones you wanted and loot them. If none of them are what you were looking for, then upon exiting warp at the next planet quickly use the Quick Warp menu to warp to the next system.\nAnother option is to warp around the system until you find an area either without enemy NPCs or outside the 4k meter detection range of enemies. Then, start flying towards the edge of space while you probe.\nIf at any time another player joins the system, warp towards another system and warplog immediately.\n(Warplogging is to log out while in warp to another system to safely despawn your ship)\nA warp charger rig is recommended for Wild System probing, as it can help you get away from pirates/drones faster when you notice \nVexnium can also be found on R structures on the ring of planets which has minimum 2 rocks to mine, it is also guarded by guardians.
