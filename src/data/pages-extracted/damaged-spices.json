Due to their nature, they are an item that can be placed in a player's inventory.\nLocation and Usage\nThe currently only source of damaged spices is from shooting dropped Spice crates. These can be obtained from players ejecting the crates, or from SP anomalies. They can be obtained by shooting at the spice crates floating about and destroying them, rather than picking them up with a hauler and transporting them. The boxes then can be looted, and damaged spice will be added to the player's inventory. It can then be sold at any market terminal, the price of damaged spice (since it is classified as an item) is a constant across the galaxy and thus doesn't matter where it's sold.",
