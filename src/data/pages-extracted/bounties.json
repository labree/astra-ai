  "summary": "Bounties are the system in which players can try to get revenge on those who kill them. If a player ends up killing you in combat, you will have 24 hours to place a bounty on that player. You cannot set a bounty on someone who hasn't killed you within the last 24 hours. Once set, a bounty lasts for two weeks, and if they are not claimed before the two weeks are over, the remaining credits are returned to the player who created the Bounty.",
  "full_text": "Bounties\nBounties are the system in which players can try to get revenge on those who kill them. If a player ends up killing you in combat, you will have 24 hours to place a bounty on that player. You cannot set a bounty on someone who hasn't killed you within the last 24 hours. Once set, a bounty lasts for two weeks, and if they are not claimed before the two weeks are over, the remaining credits are returned to the player who created the Bounty.\nRefer to Piracy for more information on how player vs player combat works.\nHow it works\nBounty money is collected when a player with a bounty is killed. The amount of the bounty that is received by the killer depends on the value of the ship that was destroyed; ground kills give no bounty.\nFor example, a player with a bounty of 25k, in a ship worth 10k, the player will remain with a bounty of 15k and the 10k will be given to the one who destroyed them.\nLocations\nBounties can be set from your Combat Log or at any Bounty Terminal, which can be found in every station. Bounties must be between 10k and 250k credits, and the money is removed from your account as soon as the bounty is set. The top 100 Bounties can be publicly viewed within a terminal, and the top 20 Bounties can be seen on \"Galaxy's Most Wanted\" news screens. You may view any Bounties placed on others by you within the terminal. If you'd like to see Bounties placed on you, your 'Career' tab will display your Bounty.\nNotes\nIt is recommended not to place bounties. Because there is no way of effectively tracking down a specific player, there are no professional bounty hunters. Your money would just be a bonus to the next person to beat them at PvP, who likely would have killed them anyway.\nBounties can act as a warning to other players that the player with a bounty is dangerous.\nYou cannot place bounties on people when you died in a stratos.",
