  "full_text": "Drone Hunting\n\nIntroduction\nDrone Hunting is a type of PvE, where a player searches for Drones in order to kill them for loot. Drones can be found in virtually every system, or in DH, BF, and SP Anomalies. Drone hunting is typically done in Wild Space, where the most Drones are present, at that, the more and most powerful, and offer the best loot table out of all system types.\nDrone Factories\nDrone Factories are large structures that are guarded by many drones, and have multiple parts a player must destroy before destroying the Factory itself. These typically drop large amounts of Scrap, Power cells, miscellaneous Materials, and rarely Hybrid Items, which are comparable to Dread or Ancient items in terms of quality.\nDrone Hideouts\nDrone Hideouts are an Anomaly that contains various Drone Structures and many Drones of specific types. They are typically not hunted exclusively, but instead are destroyed when hunting for other targets. These contain drone structures such as hangars, generators, and storeyards, however, no structures generate or regenerate health points for these structures. Drone turrets may spawn as well, as well as other drones. Loot found is usually comprised of moderately-sized amounts of non-exotic materials, such as Axnit, Narcor, and Junk such as drone cores and power cells.\nDrone Fleets\nDrone Fleets are large masses of drones that attack in a set amount of waves and include a unique Command type Drone in the last wave. More information can be found here. \nStrategy\nAny ship can be used for Drone Hunting, but warships are the most popular and often recommended due to their durability and higher damage output. Most players prefer taking the Hull Booster or Repairer Subsytem and using Blaster or Coilgun Turrets (because of their high dps). Flak Turrets can also be equipped to expedite the killing of Drone Interceptors and Fighters, but they should not be a serious threat. When searching for Drone Fleets, it's recommended to only enter and exit Wild Space through a less-trafficked warp route or Wormhole to avoid Pirates.\nWhen actually battling larger groups of drones, such as hideouts or fleets, attack the biggest ships first, as they are the most likely to kill you, then deal with the fighters and interceptors.\nShips like the Justice, Bulwark, Echelon, and Conciliator excel at drone hunting.\nIt never hurts to stop and rest, warp away and give yourself and your ship a minute to repair and recharge when you need it.",
