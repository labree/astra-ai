  "full_text": "Kodiak\n\"The Kodiak is a large mining platform capable of quickly stripping asteroids of ore. With two dedicated combat turret slots, the Kodiak can defend itself against threats which could otherwise interrupt its operation.\"\nThe Kodiak is a frigate-sized miner of the Everest ship line. It is best suited as a powerful warship miner, a step above the Ozark.\nAdvantages\nThe Kodiak has more HP, mining ability, and extra turrets for defense compared to its predecessor the Ozark. Compared to other non-designated mining ships, its role bonuses allow it to mine much more quickly, and its top-heavy turret placement makes it easy to aim and use mining turrets. It can carry two cargo crates as well, allowing it to stay in wild space longer than the Ozark before returning.\nDisadvantages\nDue to being a warship miner, it is slower than fighter-style miners. In addition, its top-heavy turret placement leaves an almost uncovered blindspot on its bottom, and agile corvettes or fightercraft can abuse this to easily kill a Kodiak. As a mining ship, it naturally lacks combat capabilities, and can only equip 4 combat turrets (including PDT's) at maximum.\nTrivia\n- The current Kodiak is modeled by Drezzlez.\n- The Kodiak's cargo crates were unintentional, the original Kodiak remodel that had crates was swapped out during for Drezzlez's model, however the cargo stat was never fixed before Next Gen's release.\nMiners\nLine\nT1\nT2\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nBadger\nBadger\nHoney Badger\nMarlin\nMarlin\nMako\nEverest\nOzark\nKodiak\nYukon\nEos\nKoronis\nEos\nVesta",
