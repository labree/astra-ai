  "full_text": "Medium Turrets\n\nMedium Turret Info\nMedium Turrets are an item which can be equipped to sub-capital and capital ships, Destroyer class or above. The current Medium Turrets are the Beam-M turret, Cannon-M turret, Coilgun-M turret, Railgun-M turret turret, Ion-M turret, and Blaster-M turret. With the exception of the Ancient tiers, all of these turrets can be crafted. All turrets have 3 levels (I, II, and III respectively), and some of them can be crafted into Dread or Hybrid variants once the necessary blueprints have been aquired. Similar to small turrets, they each have their own visual cursor which indicates where it is currently aiming.\nDamage Per Second\nTurret\nI\nII\nIII\nExotic\nNotes\nBlaster-M\n96\n102\n108\n114\nRapid-firing\nCannon-M\n101.2\n108.8\n116.2\n123.8\nSlow-firing\nCoilgun-M\n90\n96\n102\n108\n65% damage to shield, 125% damage to hull\nIon-M\n90\n96\n102\n108\n65% damage to hull, 125% damage to shield\nBeam-M\n44.7\n48.7\n52.6\n56.6\nInstantaneous burst damage, dropoff over range\nRailgun-M\n35.4\n38.8\n42.1\n45.4\nLong-range sniper, less damage to shield, extra damage to hull\nMaterial Costs\nTurret\nTier I\nTier II\nTier III\nExotic\nCannon-M\nKorrelite 160x, Reknite 120x, Gellium 80x\nCannon-M I, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nCannon-M II, Red Narcor 40x\nHybrid\nDrone core 20x, Cannon M III, Power cell 20x, Hybrid Cannon-M Blueprint\nRailgun-M\nKorrelite 160x, Reknite 120x, Gellium 80x\nRailgun-M I, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nRailgun-M II, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nDread\nRailgun-M III, Dread Railgun-M Blueprint, Metal scraps 200x, Power cell 20x\nAncient\nUncraftable\nBeam-M\nKorrelite 160x, Reknite 120x, Gellium 80x\nBeam-M I, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nBeam-M II, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nHybrid\nBeam-M III, Drone core 20x, Power cell 20x, Hybrid Beam-M Blueprint\nBlaster-M\nKorrelite 160x, Reknite 120x, Gellium 80x\nBlaster-M I, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nBlaster-M II, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nHybrid\nHybrid Blaster-M Blueprint, Blaster-M III, Drone core 20x, Power cell 20x\nCoilgun-M\nKorrelite 160x, Reknite 120x, Gellium 80x\nCoilgun-M I, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nCoilgun-M II, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nDread\nCoilgun-M III, Dread Coilgun-M Blueprint, Power cell 20x, Metal Scraps 200x\nAncient\nUncraftable\nIon-M\nKorrelite 160x, Reknite 120x, Gellium 80x\nIon-M I, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nIon-M II, Axnit 80x, Narcor 40x\nHybrid\nIon-M III, Power cell 20x, Hybrid Ion-M Blueprint, Drone core 20x\nTurret List\nBeam-M Turret\nThe Beam Turret is a slow moving and firing turret which, when held down, fires a powerful beam, delivering heavy damage on a successful strike. The beam turret deals multi-hit damage meaning that how long the beam stays in contact with the enemy determines how much damage it deals. When a full strike is landed beams have the highest single-shot damage of all the turrets. Beam turrets also have the slowest firing speed of all turrets, and the slowest rotation. Although beams do more pure dps than railguns, it is unlikely that you will pull a full strike on an enemy, so it usually does less damage than railguns. While these are good, they should be avoided as uses are limited.\nIn addition, beams have damage falloff, meaning that they do less damage the farther they travel. This makes Railguns preferable for most sniping.\nRailgun-M\nRailguns are the kinetic counterparts to beams, however they are projectile based and require players to lead their shots in order to hit other ships. Like other kinetic turrets, these do decreased damage to shields and increased damage to hull. This turret requires more time to recharge than beams making it have less pure dps than beams. Railguns only fire one shot rather than a burst, like the beams. Decent in PVP and Decent in PVE.\nCannon-M\nThe Cannon Turret fires slowly and has a slow projectile speed, and each shot does a lot damage. This turret also boasts the highest dps of all the turrets. Amazing for PVP and decent in structure PVE.\nBlaster-M\nWhile having less dps than cannons, they fire faster and have a faster projectile speed, and are thus better for faster targets. Amazing at PVE and decent at PVP\nCoilgun-M\nCoilguns are similar to cannons but have the kinetic bonus making it deal more damage to hull and less to shield. Coilguns have a 4k range as opposed to the energy weapon version of cannons being 3k. Decent in both PVP and PVE, although cannons or blasters are preferred.\nIon-M\nOpposite of the Coilgun, doing more damage to shield than hull. It also has a slower projectile speed traded for a faster turn rate, unlike the coilgun. These are quite bad in general and should be avoided as uses are extremely limited.\nThe only shield tanks in the game are the Liberty, Virtue, and Justice. This is the only scenario where ions would be useful.",
