  "full_text": "Faction Relations\n\nIntroduction\nIn Starscape, there are seven primary NPC factions. These factions are the Lycentian Federation, the Kavani Mandate, the Foralkan Empire, CoreSec, the Trade Union, the Syndicate, and the Mining Guild. Players in-game can enlist in the starfleet of any of the three warring factions; Lycentia, Kavani and Foralkus. The other four NPC factions do not directly take part in the faction warfare system. CoreSec is the central power in the Starscape galaxy, and they focus on keeping galactic peace and training clones to fight drones. The Trade Union focuses on profit and trade with the six other factions in the game. The Syndicate is presumably a criminal group, which like the Trade Union, focuses on profit; albeit by more ethically questionable means. They also focus on trading with the six other factions, and are a prime spot for spice hauling, if you can survive the trip. The Mining Guild focuses on mining bulk and rare ores, and are situated on the inner edge of wild space to facilitate their mining operations.\nThe Lycentian Federation\nThe Lycentian Federation is the oldest space-faring civilizations, and has existed for millennia. Lycentia has positive relations with CoreSec. The Trade Union and the Syndicate both sell military supplies to Lycentian warzones. The Trade Union has permits to operate within the Federation's space. Lycentia is one of the three warring factions, and is currently at war with both the Foralkan Empire and the Kavani Mandate. The Foralkan Empire actually used to be a part of the Lycentian Federation, but broke off about 100 years ago under the lead of a single rogue fleet admiral- Admiral, now Emperor, Hippaforalkus.\nThe Kavani Mandate\nThe Kavani Mandate is one of the oldest space-faring civilizations in the game, though younger than Lycentia, and was once a small, isolated, technocratic nation. Recently, they shed this isolationist strategy and became much more militarized. The Kavani Mandate is one of the three warring factions, and is currently at war with The Lycentian Federation and The Foralkan Empire. They maintain positive relations with CoreSec. The Trade Union, and the Syndicate sell military supplies to the Kavani navy, and the Trade Union has permits to operate inside of the Mandate's territory. The Kavani Mandate has been at war with the Lycentian Federation since the creation of the Foralkan Empire, which the Kavani actively encouraged, before turning on the Foralkans and annexing the region known as the Second Mandate.\nThe Foralkan Empire\nThe Foralkan Empire is the newest space-faring civilization, and is about 100 years old. The Foralkan Empire seceded from The Lycentian Federation under the lead of a single rogue fleet admiral, and has been at war ever since. The Foralkan Empire is one of the three warring factions, and is currently at war with both the Lycentian Federation and the Kavani Mandate. The Foralkan Empire maintains positive relations with CoreSec. They purchase military supplies from both the Trade Union and the Syndicate, and the Trade Union has permits to operate within the Empire's boundaries.\nCoreSec\nCoreSec, known as The Core System Security Operation, is the central power in the Starscape galaxy. They are neutral with every other NPC faction, with the exception of the Syndicate, which they presumably have a negative attitude towards. They maintain a monopoly on cloning bays across the galaxy, which they use to fund their military and stations. CoreSec is also fully responsible for the upkeep of the Citadel, and the six other main core systems in the center of the galaxy. CoreSec, being a neutral entity does not take part in the Great War. Currently, the only entities CoreSec is actively fighting against are the drones and pirates.\nThe Trade Union\nThe Interstellar Trade Union is a small faction, and composed entirely of secure systems. They are allied with every other NPC faction, and they sell supplies to the three warring factions. The Trade Union is primarily focused on making money through mining and trading, and accounts for over half the galactic trade and mining revenue. The Trade Union is also the only faction to have no standing military, though they have freighters operating throughout most of the galaxy.\nThe Syndicate\nThe Syndicate is another small faction, and the only one composed entirely of unsecure systems. Syndicate territory is surrounded almost entirely by wild space, and is separated from the rest of the colonized galaxy. The Syndicate is focused on making money through hauling spice and trading with the other NPC factions. They are neutral with every faction except CoreSec, which disapproves of the Syndicate's criminal activity. The Syndicate also sells supplies to the three warring factions' frontlines. They possess wild space mining outposts, guarded by Syndicate fighters, and they have freighters operating in unsecure and wild space.\nThe Mining Guild\nThe Galactic Mining Guild is an industrial cooperative operating on the inner edge of wild space. In spite of their location, they are composed entirely of secure systems. They focus on the recovery of bulk and scarce ores for sale on the galactic market, but unlike the Trade Union and Syndicate, they do not operate freighters to sell their ore. The Mining Guild operates military fleets to protect itself, but only from drones and pirates and exclusively within their established territory. Despite ostensibly poor relations with the Trade Union, Union freighters can still be found in Guild space.",
