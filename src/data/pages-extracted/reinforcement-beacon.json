  "full_text": "Reinforcement Beacon\nA Foralkan player securing a reinforcement beacon in a newly-claimed territory on a Lycentian-Foralkan front of Vornada-5\nOverview\nYou will find this in one of the planets of any contested systems, sometimes alongside another existing FW structure. The beacon itself is not anything interesting in appearance, however the insignia of the faction capturing it will be displayed. There’s a moderate outline of the radius around the beacon, in which you will have to go inside the zone. Once there, you need to wait until the bar on top of your screen reaches 100%. This bar will reset upon leaving the zone or the planet. When it does reach 100%, assuming you fend off some invaders and threats, a fleet will arrive to your location. \nThe fleet will randomly go to a generator and start attacking it. Although, they might follow you to another generator. The fleet consists of ships small as Fighters and Interceptors to big as Destroyers or Cruisers. The fleet doesn’t follow you to the Headquarters of the system. This structure can be avoided when capturing a moderately defended system, provided you and other players have enough firepower and defence to make up for it. However, in Stronghold systems, you might want to use this since it can reduce a good fraction of the time capturing the system ",
