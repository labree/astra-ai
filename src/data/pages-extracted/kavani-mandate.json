  "full_text": "Kavani Mandate\nThe Kavani Mandate is one of Starscape's three military factions. It claims disputed sovereignty over the Contact, Valence, and Passage contested systems, and exercises undisputed sovereignty over the secure and unsecure First Mandate and Second Mandate. It is located in the south-west side of the map, bordering the Foralkan Empire, the Lycentian Federation and sometimes the Trade Union (Depending upon the Foralkan-Kavani contested Border).\nIn-game Description:\n\"The Kavani Mandate was once a small technocratic nation situated entirely around its claim to the First Mandate, a sparsely populated region centered on the home system of Kavani humans: Vanos, and its planet Kavanos, the home and capital planet of the Kavani Mandate. For centuries, it existed as such, protective of its borders and systems but isolating itself from the galaxy at large. Within the past century, the Mandate underwent a period of reform, shedding its isolationist ethic and culminating in its annexation of the region it claims as its Second Mandate. The reawakening of the Kavani has given Lycentian strategists cause for alarm, and tensions between the Mandate and its rivals have never been higher.\"\nMilitary\nThe Kavani Mandate's military force consists of ships from the Mandator line. Their warships tend to be more agile but less armored than their counterparts that are made by other factions. The Kavani use designs with sidepod engines and a top-heavy turret design.\nSovereign Fleet\nThe Kavani military is called the Sovereign Navy. They are incredibly powerful, and their logo is green and yellow patterned. They patrol the capital system, Vanos, Lisin, and Uaspogar, but can often also be found across the Mandate and the Core. They fly warships of the Mandator Line, including the Subjugator cruiser and the Conqueror battleship. You can also see them in some contested systems occasionally, and they are extremely dangerous to hostile players and NPCs.\nEnlisting\nPlayers can enlist in the Kavani Mandate army by talking to a Kavani Recruiter NPC. You can find these recruiters in Kavani field offices at Kavani military stations, as well as by the faction terminal in Contested HQs and in the Kavani Embassy at the Citadel. Once enlisted, players cannot resign until they have served for at least 24 hours.\nPolitics\nThe Mandate is stated as non-democratic in comparison to Lycentia. The government is centralized around a High Council — since these officials are not elected, members are appointed some other way, possibly through a selection process. This council maintains a significant level of control over the raw resources within the Mandate, directing it towards research and other projects for the good of the state. \nThe Kavani philosophy centers around the pursuing of better technology. The faction existed in isolation around the First Mandate for a large portion of its history, only focusing on inward matters. The implication being that the entire philosophy of the Mandate centers around that of efficiency and order. The ruling class are the educated and enlightened, and within the limited sphere they once resigned themselves to, they learned to create whatever suited their needs using as little as possible. Quality, not quantity, is the goal of any kind of production. This reflects in their military strategy — their ships focus on tech and versatility rather than sheer firepower or strength in numbers. \nTheir current hostilities towards Lycentia and Foralkus are not justified through will of conquest or to spread their ideology, but they instead claim to fight simply to protect their own safety, perceiving the two nations as consistent existential threats to their way of life. The Kavani were formerly an ally to the Foralkan Empire through a common enemy during their secession, and Lycentian officials claim the alliance and preemptive attacks by the Kavani were what allowed the Empire to sucessfully secede to begin with. \nOtherwise, Kavani maintains positive relations with Coresec, and permits the Trade Union to do business within their territory. They claim themselves to be overall neutral and friendly towards other nations. \nStanding/Loyalty Points\nReputation for the Kavani Mandate, like all NPC factions, can be earned by doing missions, turning in faction reputation items, and hauling Kavani supplies to a non-stronghold Kavani Contested (Orange system). Gaining more reputation allows you to do higher paying missions, and access certain perks, such as the Kavani skin or uniforms. The highly sought-after Kavani ship blueprints and other faction related items are locked behind joining the Kavani Sovereign Navy and increasing your military rank.\nReputation Items\nStanding Items are a type of loot which can be used to increase standing with certain NPC factions. Standing items can be turned in using a Kavani terminal located in Kavani field offices, or by talking to the Kavani Mandate ambassador located at the Citadel. Kavani reputation items can be acquired by killing Lycentian or Foralkan ships, buying reputation items from freighters, or buying them from other players on the Player Market. \nItem\nEffect\nForalkan/Lycentian Insignia\n+7\nForalkan/Lycentian Pilot Helmet\n+15\nForalkan/Lycentian Mission Log\n+30\nAgent System Locations\nTier 0\nTier 1\nTier 2\nTier 3\nTier 4\nTier 5\nAstiboak\nAxsiolk\nAxsiolk\nAstiboak\nAengblo\nBri'ut\nAstkemo\nOasptaex\nEetas\nEogsearom\nAlteelkeet\nDroherclu\nEetas\nSteahaem\nHirsi\nOasptaex\nAnsirio\nEastbet\nEpsilon Umke\nVanos\nRigroplea-4\nUmod\nEastbet\nGamma Klaix\nVanos\nVuarom\nSteahaem\nVuarom\nHirpair\nHirpair\nTuwo\nIscid'es\nIscid'es\nVanos\nItith\nItith\nVaret\nOthath-dio\nNadmois\nPolkua\nOthath-dio\nRetoow\nPloo Ab\nStaunoct\nPolkua\nUarkiolo\nQuafirom\nYxcle\nStaunoct\nStocakeo\nUarkiolo\nViaret\nRewards\nAs a military faction, the Kavani Mandate offers both regular standing rewards and military rewards.\nStanding Rewards\nItem Type\nItem\nTier\nDescription\nTitle\nI\nUnlocks equippable \"Kavani Associate\" title.\nFurniture\nI\nCan now purchase a Kavani Mandate Banner at a Kavani terminal for 50 loyalty points.\nFurniture\nI\nCan now purchase a Kavani Mandate Holoprojector at a Kavani terminal for 25 loyalty points.\nUpgrade\nII\nCan now purchase a Kavani Targeter II at a Kavani terminal for 50 loyalty points.\nPerk\nIII\nDiscounts Kavani warp relay jumps by 25%.

There are three cases which make Kavani ships hostile: When a player attacks their ships, when a player has enlisted in another faction’s military and is in a contested system, or when a player has -1500 standing (Enemy). Additionally, players with -500 standing (Suspect) will not be allowed to enter Kavani military stations.\nIn contested space, hangars part of the Mandate will produce fighters to assist in the defense of the system. The AI is spread around to different structures, most commonly the Generator, and flies around it until a known threat is in the planet or system. When a pirate or enemy faction fleet, or a player of an opposing faction warps in, all ships built by the hangar and randomly generated fleets will warp towards the threat, attempting to eliminate or deter them.\nThe Kavani Mandate fires on any drones or NPC pirates that are in their targeting range, as well as ships from the Foralkan Empire and Lycentian Federation.",
