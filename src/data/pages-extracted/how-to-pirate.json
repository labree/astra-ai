  "full_text": "How to Pirate\n\nA Guide to Piracy.\nThe act of Piracy is an act that players do to get items from killing other players. This is usually done by camping a certain PVP enabled system, such as common routes to wilds/contested or inner core unsecures such as Gatinsir, Emas, or Aerelet.\nRecommended tactics\nUsing ships that can dish out high DPS are a good choice, if you want to kill players who just warped in. Fast ships such as the Falcon line can deal with bigger ships due to their speed. In Wild Space, use a Warp Disruptor at the system Warp Hub, to prevent the victims from warping away. Be warned, as some players hunt player-pirates.\nCamp Pirating\nThis is camping the system Warp Hub, and killing passerby who warp in. In Wilds, requesting a ransom also works, as players might as well lose some items rather than lose their ship permanently. Some pirates will kill the player if they give the ransom, although this is looked down upon even by other pirates.\nTravel Pirating\nThis is literally killing whoever player you find while traveling through PVP enabled systems.",
