  "full_text": "Interface\nThe UI in Starscape consists of six general parts, divided into further sub-sections: the Inventory, the GUI, the Radial Menu, the Quickwarp Menu, the Solar Map, and the Galaxy Map. This page will go over the functions and appearance of the various UI features existing in Starscape.\nInventory\nThe Inventory UI is the player's main method of viewing their progress and assets in the Starscape universe. It is the largest UI in terms of content, featuring many sub-sections. As such, it will be divided into sections: the Topnav Bar, the Sidenav Bar, and the Equip Bar, for the ease of access of this guide.\nTopnav Bar\nThe Topnav Bar shows the immediately useful information the player usually needs. It consists of the player's Assets, Missions, Skills, Research, Career and Shop menus.\nAssets\nFor more information on Terminals, consult the stations page.\nThis is where all the player's possessions are catalogued. The screens in this menu can be sorted using the sidebar for category, or be sorted using a searchbar and filter, and the UI scaling can be adjusted into scales of GRD4, GRD6, or as a list. This is almost identical to the UI when accessing storage terminals. It consists of 4 tabs:\n- The Inventory tab shows the player's current inventory; however, any items that have been packaged into cargo crates will be shown in the Cargo tab of the Equip Bar. Any equipped items will be greyed out with an equipped text above them, and will be inaccessible.\n- The Storage tab shows the player's current storage. It functions similarly to the Inventory Tab, but shows items in the player's Storage instead. Items in this tab cannot be interacted with unless a player is using a Storage Terminal.\n- The Spacecraft tab shows the player's currently assembled ships. The player is able to rename these ships, and searching the custom names of your ships will also cause them to be filtered like any other default item would.\n- The Cosmetics tab is the only aspect of the Inventory Tab that cannot be directly interacted with - instead, this tab lists the player's owned unlimited cosmetics. Ethereal skins are not included in this but in the Storage or Inventory tabs. Players can apply these skins to their ships through the customization screen.\nSkills\nFor more information on Skills, consult the skills page.\nThis UI allows the player to adjust and view their current skills. It consists of 4 Constellations:\n- The Combat Constellation involves skills that increase loot drops from combat and combat effectiveness.\n- The Industry Constellation involves skills that increase the profit of activities such as mining, refining, and crafting items.\n- The Commerce Constellation involves skills related to trading on the player market and with NPC spice traders or mission providers.\n- The Exploration Constellation involves skills related to exploring, whether it be the effectiveness of hacking operations or advanced probe operations.\nResearch\nFor more information on Research, consult the research page.\nThe Research function has not yet been implemented into the game.\nCareer\nFor more information on NPC relations, consult the faction relations page.\nThe Career page shows the player's progress in Starscape, as well as equippable titles that will appear over their avatar. It consists of 3 general sections:\n- The Faction Warfare section on the top, showing the player's current NPC faction alignment, if any.\n- The Faction Standing section on the left, showing NPC opinions of the player. Any factions that are hostile by default will not be shown here.\n- The Title section on the left center, showing equippable titles the player has acquired.\n- The Progress section on the right center, showing the player's progress to new equippable titles.\n- The Stats section on the right, showing a summary of all of the player's gameplay stats, such as ore mined, time played, and deaths.\nShop\nFor more information on Stardust, consult the Stardust page.\nThis UI allows for the players to purchase Stardust with Robux, and purchase more cosmetics or other non-advantageous items with Stardust. The Shop will never sell any items that give a pay-to-win advantage. It consists of 5 tabs:\n- The Featured tab, showing currently discounted items, a featured bundle, and an ad for buying Stardust.\n- The Cosmetics tab, where players are able to buy Skins, Trails, and Symbols for their ships.\n- The Starliners tab, which has not yet been implemented.\n- The Cybermods tab, which has not yet been implemented.\n- The Outfits tab, which has not yet been implemented.\nSidenav Bar\nThe Sidenav Bar shows less immediately important settings. It consists of the Settings, Rental, Faction, Squad, Tags, Manufacturing, Combat Log, Transaction Log, Item Directory, Help, and Safelog menus.\nSettings\nThe Settings screen allows the player to adjust how their game functions client-side. It currently houses the following options:\n- Music volume, a slider which adjusts the volume music is played at.\n- Interface volume, a slider which adjusts the volume UI interaction feedback is played at.\n- Invert flight camera, a toggle which inverts the Y-axis of flight controls. This is off by default.\n- Invert warship pitch, a toggle which switches the functions tied to the W and S keys for warships. This is off by default.\n- Disable unsecure warnings, a toggle which disables warnings when warping to an unsecure system. This is on by default.\n- Disable wild warnings, a toggle which disables warnings when warping to a wild system. This is on by default.\n- Show flight controls, a toggle which decides whether or not flight controls are showed. This is on by default, and is turned on again upon piloting a warship.\n- Allow trade requests, a menu which decides who can send you trade requests. It goes through the All, Friends, and None preferences, and is on All by default.\n- Allow duel requests, a menu which decides who can send you duel requests. It goes through the All, Friends, and None preferences, and is on All by default.\n- Allow squad invites, a menu which decides who can send you squad invites. It goes through the All, Friends, and None preferences, and is on All by default.\n- Allow faction invites, a menu which decides who can send you player faction invites. It goes through the All, Friends, and None preferences, and is on All by default. If you are already in a faction, anyone attempting to invite you will be denied.\n- Ship comms chatter, a menu which decides if NPC chatter is shown on your GUI and if a notification comes with it. It goes through the On, Silent, and Off preferences, and is on On by default.\n- Graphics quality, a menu which decides the graphical quality of textures, warp bubbles, and performance related effects. It goes through the Low, Medium, High and Ultra preferences, and is on High by default.\nRentals\nFor more information on Residentials, consult the stations page.\nThe Rentals screen shows the player's currently rented residence, and allows them to see Rental Time, Rental Fees, and end their rental. If the player does not own one, they will be met with a prompt telling them to go rent one.\nFaction\nFor more information on Factions, consult the factions page.\nThe Factions screen shows the player's current player faction.
