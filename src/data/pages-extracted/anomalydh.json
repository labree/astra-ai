  "summary": "Drone Hideouts (also known as Anomaly:DH, DH Anomalies, or Drone Hangars), are an anomaly that can be found in all systems except Core and Gate. These anomalies consist of several random immobile drone structures, including Storeyards, Generators and Hangars. When a player warps in, many drones will spawn in the anomaly, often consisting of only a few specific types. The strength and numbers of the drones depend on the security level of the system- secure, contested, unsecure, or wild. Despite the Hideouts sometimes spawning with a Drone Hangar, these do not spawn the drones. The structures can be destroyed and looted, often containing high quantities of scrap, and occasionally also dropping Materials such as Axnit or Narcor. They have also been known to drop Hybrid Ship Blueprints",
