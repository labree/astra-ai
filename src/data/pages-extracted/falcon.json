  "full_text": "Falcon\n\"The Falcon is a swift starship designed for overtaking other ships in warp and having unmatched speed on the battlefield.\"\nThe Falcon is an entry-level interceptor-class ship of the Defiance ship line. It is best suited as a hard-to-catch scouting ship.\nAdvantages\nThe Falcon is incredibly fast, making it a good ship for prospecting hunters to disrupt enemies while reinforcements arrive, and allows it to pick its engagements, diving in to pick off an enemy and flying away before backup can arrive. It is fairly cheap for its speed and can be used well as a disposable scout ship.\nDisadvantages\nThe Falcon is an entry-level ship, and thus will perform poorly against upgraded fightercraft. As an interceptor itself, warships with turret hardpoints or point defense will be able to gun it down very quickly. Compared to the Zenith, it has much less durability, and a stray shot can easily break an unwary pilot.\nTrivia\n- The current Falcon is modeled by swindle150.\nInterceptors\nLine\nT1\nT2\nExotic\nDefiance\nFalcon\nParagon\nHybrid Paragon\nValiance\nZenith\nPolaris\nHybrid Polaris\nMegalodon\nMackerel\nCandiru\nMandator\nParrot\nMacaw\nRighteous\nTetra\nTriazo\nDefiance Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nFalcon\nT2\nParagon\nExotic\nHybrid Paragon",
