Though it doesn't handle movement particularly well, it is perfectly content sitting in place while devastating its enemies.\"\nThe Phalanx is a frigate-class ship of the Legionis ship line. It is best suited as a tanky fleet ship.\nAdvantages\nTrue to its description, the Phalanx excels at sitting back and hitting enemies, tanking even destroyer volleys with ease. Its turret placement is focused around shooting enemies from afar, though it is not a kiting ship - rather, it is meant to fly with a fleet, compensating for speed through sheer mass.\nDisadvantages\nDue to the Phalanx's hull focus, pilots should take care to avoid kinetic based weaponry. It is not very maneuvrable , being less agile than the typical frigate, and can be kited easily. It is most effective in a large group, where other pilots can cover the weaknesses of the Phalanx allowing it to truly stand out at doing its job, Pilots should think of the Phalanx as the anvil of a hammer-and-anvil combination.\nTrivia\n- The current Phalanx is modeled by ii_Cove and Axaraz.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nLegionis Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nAurora\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nT2\nLuminar\nExotic\nHybrid Luminar",
