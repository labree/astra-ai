  "summary": "Frigates are expensive warships with a different control system to starfighters and a turret modification system. While slower than starfighters and corvettes, they have the capability to deal much more damage, be more dynamic, and have larger roles in an organized fleet. Frigates are seen as a requirement for late-game PvE. Compared to corvettes, frigates are less agile but able to take and deal more damage. Additionally, Frigates require 100 Red Narcor to build, which can only be obtained from Wild Space asteroids, from Command Drones, Drone Megacomplexes, Drone Battleships, or crates in X-Structure aberrations",
