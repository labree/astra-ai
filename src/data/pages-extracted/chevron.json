  "full_text": "Chevron\n\"The Chevron is a workhorse warship that makes up for its lack in agility with strength and stubbornness.\"\nThe Chevron is a corvette-class ship of the Legionis ship line. It is best suited as a sturdy fleet ship.\nAdvantages\nThe Chevron is the most durable corvette in the game, making it good for NPC hunting, as it can sustain a good amount of damage before retreating. In addition, it is the only corvette capable of unleashing a full broadside, meaning it has 360 degrees of possible attack vectors horizontally. As corvettes are faster than other warships, it is still faster than large ships, despite being a slow corvette. As a new player, this is a solid choice for a combat corvette.\nDisadvantages\nThe Chevron is clunky and slow compared to other corvettes, meaning that in a 1 on 1 engagement, it can be outmaneuvered and kited if a pilot is not careful. In addition, while its broadside capabilities horizontally are well-off, vertically its turret placement suffers heavily.\nBecause of it's high hull and low shield, it is vulnerable to kinetic weaponry, and in PvP, it has less opportunity to retreat into a station (as ships are blocked from entering stations if they run out of shield)\nTrivia\n- The current Chevron is modeled by ii_Cove and Axaraz.\n- The Chevron was formerly named the Dolphin due to the fin on its Pre-Next Gen model.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nLegionis Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nAurora\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nT2\nLuminar\nExotic\nHybrid Luminar",
