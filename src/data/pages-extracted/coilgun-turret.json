  "full_text": "Coilgun Turret\nSmall Turrets can only be equipped onto ships with S Turret Slots. Small ships such as Badger, Aurora, or Bison do not have S turret slots and cannot have S-turrets equipped. For the small autoturrets that some small ships have, see PDT.\nCoilgun Turret (Small)\nCoilgun turrets are turrets which deal a moderate amount of damage per shot, with a moderate fire rate, a moderate velocity, and a medium range. They do 0.65x of their stated damage per shot against shield, and 1.25x against hull. In other words, they do extra hull damage and less shield damage.\nTheir average fire rate and high DPS makes them ideal for PVE combat, since most NPC ships have hull-based ships, the exceptions being Lycentian NPCs using their Righteous ships and NPC pirates using Constellation ships. \nThey can shred through any players that use Hull Boosters or Hull Repairers, yet are hard countered by Shield Boosters and Shield Repairers, or ships with high amounts of shield, such as the Justice.\nCoilguns come in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Exotic variants. Coilguns come in two Exotic variants: Dread and Ancient. These turrets have identical stats, but are obtained different ways; Ancient Coilguns can only be found in X-Structures, whereas Dread Coilguns need to be crafted from scrap, a Tier 3 Coilgun, and a Dread Coilgun blueprint, obtained from Dread Pirates and Pirate Dens. \nCoilgun-M Turret (Medium)\nCoilgun-M turrets are very similar to their S variant. They have greater firepower and lower maneuverability. Medium turrets can only be equipped onto ships with Medium Turret Slots. They possess mediocre firepower, with a 0.65x damage debuff against enemy shields and a 1.25x damage buff against enemy hull.\nCoilgun-M turrets come in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Exotic variants. Coilgun-Ms come in two Exotic variants: Dread and Ancient. Dread and Ancient Coilgun-Ms have identical stats, but are obtained different ways; Ancient Coilgun-Ms can only be found in X-Structures, whereas Dread Coilgun-Ms need to be crafted from scrap, a Tier 3 Coilgun-M, and a Dread Coilgun-M blueprint, obtained from Dread Pirates and Pirate Dens.\nManufacturing\nThe manufacturing costs for each Coilgun variant are listed as follows:\nCoilgun (Small)\nTier 1\n80 Korrelite, 60 Reknite, 40 Gellium\nTier 2\n40 Axnit, 20 Narcor, Coilgun I\nTier 3\n20 Red Narcor, Coilgun II\nDread\n100 Metal scraps, 10 Power cell, Coilgun III, Dread Coilgun blueprint\nAncient\nUncraftable\nCoilgun-M (Medium)\nTier 1\n160 Korrelite, 120 Reknite, 80 Gellium\nTier 2\n80 Axnit, 40 Narcor, Coilgun-M I\nTier 3\n40 Red Narcor, Coilgun-M II\nDread\n200 Metal scraps, 20 Power cell, Coilgun-M III, Dread Coilgun-M blueprint\nAncient\nUncraftable",
