  "full_text": "The Citadel\nThe Citadel is a large space station which serves as the central hub of the galaxy. It is located over the planet, The Citadel, and system, The Citadel. This is to prevent newer players from getting lost no matter what map they are looking at. The Citadel has three levels and an observatory. From bottom to top, they are the lower level, the docking bays, and the upper level. The Citadel is the only station to have four docking bays, and representatives from each of the 7 factions. \nThe Citadel also contains the main Cloning Bay, which acts as a spawn point for new players, and everyone else who hasn't set their spawn in another Core System. Due to this, the Citadel often has several Overflow Servers. The high traffic and central location also cause The Citadel's Player Market to be the most frequently used Player Market, with the Harbor market close behind because of Harbor's cheap listing fees.\nEmbassies\nOn the Docking bay level of the citadel are 4 embassies, for the 3 warring factions and the Trade Union. In the lower level, you can find a CoreSec field office and a small Mining Guild stand. The Syndicate does not have a proper embassy, instead for Syndicate matters you must talk to John Doe, who is on the uppermost level behind a plant.\nThe main functions of the embassies are to reset your Standing. If your standing with a faction has become so low that their ships have become hostile to you, making it impossible to complete missions, you can talk to an ambassador to reset your standing to 0 for a fee. (This costs 5 credits per standing point. In the case of the maximum, -2000, it comes out to 10,000 credits).\nIn addition, the embassies are a convenient place to turn in Salvage items for standing, as well as enlist in a military and apply for promotions in the case of the warring factions. Note that you cannot redeem faction items using loyalty points here, instead you must find the proper office within that faction's respective territory.\nDuring one of the tutorial missions, Welcome to the Galaxy, each of the ambassadors gives you a dialogue detailing the background and lore of their factions.\nMylo Rav - Lycentian Federation Ambassador\n\"Welcome to the Lycentian Embassy. My name is Mylo Rav, and I head the diplomatic mission of the Lycentian Federation here on the Citadel.The Lycentian Federation is the eldest great power in the galaxy, and the only domain where true freedom exists. While the other great powers exercise authority over their citizens, our power exists by the authority of our people.Our territory is situated about the galactic inner northeast, and when you have the time, you must visit Lycentia Prime. The beauty of our home is unparalleled throughout the galaxy.But while our values of freedom and liberty are great, they have come at a price. You may be familiar with our counterparts, the Foralkans.Many years ago had you uttered that name, no one would have any idea what you were talking about.That is because the Foralkans are born of Lycentia. You see, we share a common ancestry. But the Foralkans exploted their autonomy and freedom to undermine the Federation and secede many years ago.Now, we live in a state of war. And while in the past we hoped for reconciliation and with the return of our brethren, that opportunity has long passed. The Kavani saw to it that our attention was focused elsewhere while the Foralkans grew stronger.Our navy, the Federal Starfleet, is tasked with protecting our borders and our people from any foreign threats, whether that be Foralkan, Kavani, or drone.If what I have said intrigues you-if you wish to defend the galaxy's great democracy-our Starfleet is always looking for enlistees. My recruiter friend can assist you there.The Federation has been for eons, and through our perseverance and will, it shall be for eons more.\"\n― Mylo Rav\nKoran Voss - Foralkan Empire Ambassador\n\"Hail the Emperor! And welcome. I am Koran Voss, the Ambassador to the Citadel for the Foralkan Star Empire.In ages past, the lumbering Lycentian Federation existed without true competition. The Kavani were young, and the drones had not become so... prolific.Their superiority made them weak. Their children grew up not understanding fear, nor combat, nor the virtue of strength. We saw what was happening. We knew what would happen to us if ever a threat should arise.So we rebelled, led by the great Admiral Hippaforalkus, now and forever our Eternal Emperor. He breathed life into this stagnant galaxy, and we won a great victory.Now the galaxy is full of terrors. The drones continue to get stronger. We were proven right. It is because of us that humanity has survived this long at all, and it is through us humanity will survive.Our Imperial Armada defends our home from the threat of conquest by the Lycentians. It too pushes back against the drone menace, and our once allies, the Kavani...If you have a desire to fight, if battle is in your blood, then you must join the Armada. With you beside us, we will grow ever stronger.\"\n― Koran Voss\nSia Ta-Zin - Kavani Mandate Ambassador\n\"Greetings traveller. I am Sia Ta-Zin. I speak for the Kavani Mandate on the Citadel.Perhaps you have met my counterparts, the ambassadors from the Federation and Empire. If you have not yet, I would not bother. Their petty concerns are beneath us.Unlike our \"competitors\", we of the Mandate do not look toward unbridled freedom or wanton combat to find meaning in our lives.Instead, the High Council directs resources toward the continued advancement of our technology... it is not through sheer force or numbers alone that we maintain our borders, but rather through our superior tactics and ships.While it is true our roots are not as deep as the Federation, we have been a pillar of this galaxy for ages, and we shall ourlast the others long into the future.There was a time when we isolated ourselves fully from the others, and worked only within our borders... but that time has long since passed. The threats to our Mandate are numerous and great.If you wish to help us defend our vision of society, the Sovereign Navy is always looking for worthy pilots.\"\n― Sia Ta-Zin\nQuinn Bartalos - Trade Union Ambassador\n\"A new face! Excellent! Welcome to the Trade Union Mission on the Citadel.You may have heard of my employer: the Interstellar Trade Union. We are the largest trade and economic organization in the galaxy! Exciting, is it not?We operate out of Union Station on Harbor, a beautiful system, not to mention prime real estate just a few jumps from the core systems!We are a neutral entity, of course, so no matter what the galactic landscape looks like you can always count on us to turn a profit! Whether it's mining, spice running, or cargo transport, we can help you out!You'll especially be interested in our exclusive lines of hauling spacecraft; they're the best in the galaxy!There's a lot to do in this galaxy, but perhaps the most exciting opportunities are the ones that provide you with immense wealth! And that's exactly what we can do for you!So, if you're ever out near Harbor, drop by one of our stations and pick up some contract missions.\"\n― Quinn Bartalos\nDex Peladrio - Mining Guild Ambassador\n\"Hello friend, haven't seen you here before. Welcome to the Citadel.I represent the Galactic Mining Guild. We're a mining cooperative located in Quarry on the inner edge of wild space.We have a small cluster of systems under our jurisdiction, but most of our associates spend most of their time out in wild space looking for rare ores.No matter who you choose to align yourself with, we're happy to help you get your career as a wilds miner off the ground.In particular, we have designed a special line of combination miner-hauler spacecraft which are perfect for those lengthy mining expeditions where cargo space is of great import.Will you get fabulously wealthy? Yeah, you might. You might also get blown up by pirates or drones. We can't really help with that. But the mining? Yeah, we can help with that.Getting to Quarry takes a while by warp alone, so I'd recommend hopping on the warp relay network at Shield and saving yourself a bunch of time if you want to come visit.\"\n― Dex Peladrio\nJohn Doe - Syndicate Representative\n\"Hello. New here? Okay. Yeah, alright, I guess you're not a cop.I work for the Syndicate. If you've ever got some special cargo and need a place to unload it, bring it up north to us.And if you ever need a fast, discrete ship... Again, just go up north. We make good stuff. System name is Syndica. Can't miss it.But if you do come to visit us, be sure to either bring a fast ship, a strong one, or both... CoreSec won't protect you on the way. It gets pretty dicey with pirates.Oh, and if you're ever in trouble with the Syndicate I can fix that up for you if you bribe me.\"\n― John Doe\nLocation\nThe Citadel is located at the central region of The Core. It is connected to 6 other star systems:\nBastion - 15.2 light-years away\nAegis - 17.2 light-years away\nShield - 17.8 light-years away\nConcord - 19.3 light-years away\nGuard - 24.1 light-years away\nTriage - 12.0 light-years away\nThe Citadel is considered a strategic position due to its close proximity to the capital systems of four other major factions and its central location in the warp relay network.\nLycentian Federation - 9 jumps\nKavani Mandate - 11 jumps\nForalkan Star Empire - 11 jumps\nTrade Union - 5 jumps\nPlanetary Properties\nThe Citadel System consists of two planets: The Citadel, and Bantam. \n \nFrom left (to right): Bantam, and The Citadel (planet). Note: The Citadel Planet picture is outdated\nBantam\nBantam is a small brown rocky planet located around 6.5 astronomical units away from the Sun, and around 4.1 astronomical units away from The Citadel. The planet has an asteroid field consisting of inferior Korrelite and Reknite. Bantam and the Citadel's Ring are common places to find new Strati chiseling away at rocks.\nThe Citadel (planet)\nThe Citadel (planet) is a semi-massive ringed ultramarine gas-giant approximately 10.6 astronomical units away from The Citadel star.
