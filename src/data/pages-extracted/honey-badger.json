It is best suited as a bulk mining ship.\nAdvantages\nThe Honey Badger is still reasonably cheap compared to warship miners, allowing it to get in spaces larger ships could not. It is the most powerful small miner in terms of mining efficiency.\nThe Honey Badger also excels at 'cherry picking' - a form of mining which involves only mining rare ores such as Red Narcor, Narcor, or Axnit.\nDisadvantages\nThe Honey Badger is tanky but slow, and will die to pirates if it is caught- like most ships.
