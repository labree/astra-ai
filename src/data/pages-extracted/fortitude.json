  "full_text": "Fortitude\n\"The Fortitude is a destroyer designed with a focus around rapid response, having a comparatively flat warp speed and charge time, as well as substantial damage and shield regen. However, its lack of overall hull and shield durability make it susceptible to melting under pressure.\"\nThe Fortitude is a destroyer-class ship of the Valiance ship line. It is best suited as a kiting ship against other ships, as it is fast and has high shield regeneration.\nGenerally, this ship should not be used due to it sacrificing a destroyer's usual amount of health for low amounts of speed. Its health pool is even worse than the Horizon, closer to the health of a Frigate than a Destroyer. \nAdvantages\nThe Fortitude, much like its predecessors, has a focus on speed and sustaining its health, which it excels at. In addition, as a destroyer, it has medium weapons capable of combating large warships that the Adamant and Infinity can not out-gun. Due to its naturally high speed and shield regeneration, it is recommended to arm it with a lightburner and railguns, to use it as a sniper.\nDisadvantages\nWhile good at kiting and sniping, it lacks the speed of its frigate and corvette counterparts, meaning that while it is able to kite/snipe other large ships like destroyers, it will be chased down by smaller warships. In addition, its health pool is small for a destroyer, and if caught, it will die quickly. Additionally, its hitbox is quite large when faced head-on and away.\nTrivia\n- The current Fortitude is modeled by Jeff_D.\nWarships\nLine\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nLegionis\nChevron\nPhalanx\nEchelon\nConstellation\nRadix\nHalo\nHorizon\nValiance\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortitude\nStronghold\nBulwark\nMegalodon\nKnifejaw\nBarracuda\nLoxodon\nMandator\nEdict\nJudicator\nConciliator\nRighteous\nLiberty\nVirtue\nJustice\nValiance Line\nInterceptor\nFighter\nCorvette\nFrigate\nDestroyer\nT1\nZenith\nInfinity\nAdamant\nFortiude\nT2\nPolaris\nExotic\nHybrid Polaris",
