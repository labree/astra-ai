  "full_text": "Editing Menu\nPlayer ships can be customized to have different weapons, increased stats, and special abilities. They can also be customized to have different paint jobs, insignias, laser colors, and exhaust trails.\nEditing Menu\nThe ship edit menu can be accessed by going to a dark blue ship spawning terminal and selecting the ship, then selecting \"Edit Loadout\". Alternatively, you can edit an already-spawned ship by going over its icon and pressing \"C\". \nAn uneditable version of the menu can also be viewed from the Spacecraft tab in your Inventory. Select the ship and select \"View Loadout\" to access it.\nThe customization menu has several elements:\n- On the top-left corner, you can see the cosmetic slots in which you equip Skins, Symbols, Lasers and Trails.\n- On the bottom-left corner, you can see the rig slots in which you equip WEP, DEF, ENG, and RCT rigs. Different ships have different amounts of rig slots.\n- On the top-right corner, you can edit the hardpoints of your ship. You can also view the amount of turrets your ship can support, if it has any.\n- On the bottom-right corner, you can see the subsystem slots of your ship. Different ships have different amounts of subsystem slots.\n- In the center, you can see a 3D visual representation of your ship. This is also where you equip turrets and change your PDT hardpoints. Turrets are equipped through items you own, while PDT hardpoints are changed through a credit fee.\n- On the very right sidebar, you can see a list of your ship's combat statistics. You can also toggle whether skills affect the calculations, and whether or not the DPS counter displays Damage Per Second or Alpha damage (the total damage of one volley from your ship).",
