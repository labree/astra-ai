For the small autoturrets that some small ships have, see PDT.\nProspector Turret (Small)\nProspector turrets are turrets similar to the Tractor PDT. \nProspector turrets are uncraftable and unobtainable. They have no ingame use. They are an item that was released early through FO shops, but then their feature was scrapped and they were removed. Originally, they would have been used to scan comet fragments to see whether they were barren or had a water ice core. However, to eliminate this annoying step, it was decided that this turret would not be added and that water ice cores would be exposed from the beginning.\nProspector turrets come only in their Tier 1 variant. Only a few exist, and they are occasionally listed on the player market for ludicrous prices, because of their status as a rare collectible.",
