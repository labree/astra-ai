  "full_text": "Credits\n\nOverview\nGalactic Credits are the primary currency of Starscape. They're used for the vast majority of player interactions in the game: in Marketplaces to buy and sell items, in player interactions, and in speeding up the repair of your ship, among other uses. Credits are used whenever a player dies. A charge of 500 Credits (Contested, unsecure, or wild) or 250 credits (Secure and core) will be taken as a fee for respawning in the Citadel - however, if a player is unable to pay the cloning fee, they will not be charged.\nWays of Obtaining\nThere are a multitude of ways to earn credits in Starscape, including but not limited to; mining ores; hauling; completing missions; hunting NPC enemies, killing players, and many more.\nMining\nMining is one of the most popular and efficient ways of earning credits in Starscape, relying on obtaining ores to sell. Strategies range from low-risk but low-reward methods such as mining basic ores in core and secure systems to high-risk and high-gain tactics such as wild mining and vexnium hunting.\nHauling\nHauling is another popular method for earning credits, focusing on delivering cargo in a Hauler-class ship to turn a profit. Favoured methods range from transporting supplies for any of the three warring factions to delivering Spice through wormholes.\nHunting\nHunting NPC enemies is a risky, but effective tactic for earning credits, that relies on fighting high-level drones and pirates to obtain expensive loot such as Red Narcor, Hybrid/Dread Blueprints and Items and even Standing Items. Pirates often drop small amounts of credits after death, and pirate dens can drop several hundred to thousands of credits when destroyed.\nPirating\nIn Contested, Unsecure, or Wild systems, pvp is enabled. This can be profitable, as a miner coming back from a large mining expedition in a wild system can be loaded with rare items. However, this is also risky as NPC's can easily kill you. You can also ransom for credits in favor for not killing the victim and saving their ship. This works best in wild, due to permadeath and nobody wants to lose their prized ship.\nAdvice\nFor more tips on some ways to start making money, visit the Making Credits page.",
