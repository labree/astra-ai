  "full_text": "Getting Started\n\nFirst Steps\nAfter completing the first tutorial, you can do 4 more optional tutorials. The Industry tutorial teaches you how to craft and manufacture items, the Combat tutorial teaches you how to fight against enemies, the faction tutorial provides information and background on each of the 6 NPC factions, and the Interface tutorial explains how the menu works. It is highly recommended that you finish these, as they provide you with a solid amount of credits and valuable experience.\nYou can mine resources to earn money and build ships. Later, when you acquire larger and more capable ships, you can start earning money through NPC hunting, hauling, and other methods. \nMining\nMining gives you some income, and provides you with valuable materials that you can use to upgrade/manufacture ships. The Badger miner is recommended because of its faster mining rate compared to the Mako. The two essential upgrades for every small mining ship are tractor beam PDTs, which draw ores towards your ship; and Rapid Bolt, which allows you to shoot faster, hence increasing mining speed. \nTo mine in a badger, go up to an asteroid, left click to blast away a chunk, and hold right click to activate the tractor beam to vacuum up the ore. There are no mining missions, so income for mining is done through sale on the player market, the two biggest hubs being at the Citadel and the Trade Union's capital, Harbor. \nGoing into unsecure/wild systems (it is ill-advised to go into an unsecure system, however, due to the number of pirates) rewards you with more bountiful and rarer ores like Axnit, Narcor, and Red Narcor, but run the risk of having your ship being destroyed by other players, as well as by NPCs if distracted. In unsecure/wild, drones are more numerous and powerful, so you should keep warping until you find a planet without threats and then deploy a scanning probe to find anomalies. Scanning probes for Anomalies or Abberations are provided for free. Certain anomalies contain rarer resources and don't contain drones so they can be extremely profitable. Secure mining can only fetch up to Gellium (Resources up to blue Narcor can be found in secure anomalies although this is almost as rare as finding Vexnium in wild systems), but can still run the risk of low level NPC drones destroying your mining ship. A good miner should be aware of the state of the player market to capitalize on swings in prices to make a profit. \nImportant Notes: If you are in a Wild/Contested/Unsecure system and a player warps in, assume they are hostile when in a miner, and do not engage them in combat. Instead, run away whenever possible. If you are caught in their warp disruption, whether by warp disruption beams or by warp disruptor bubbles, use your lightburner if you have one or attempt a lightcruise to a ring or an aberration. Attempt negotiation if that is your only option, as handing over your ores is much preferable to losing your ship and respawning at the Citadel. You should go through as much effort as possible to avoid these situations. The longer the route to enter wild space is the less likely you are to warp straight into a pirate's trap. These people most commonly camp the fast routes into wild space. \nWhen mining Reknite, Korrelite, or Gellium, try to mine the Pristine quality. You can find what type of quality an ore is as it will be called Reknite (pristine), Reknite (superior), or just Reknite. Pristine will give you 2x ore when refined, so try to mine pristine quality. For the other 3 ores,i.e Narcor, Red Narcor, Axnit, always mine them as they are rarer. It is not recommended to try and mine Vexnium asteroids as there are NPCs that guard them and can annihilate you quickly if you are in a small mining ship. You can also get some upgrades such as patcher nanobots in order to increase the amount of time you can mine before having to go to a space station. When mining, prioritize your safety above all. A dead miner means no ores are coming home, so store your ores whenever possible.\nMissions\nMissions are a good secondary path for new players, while not being quite as profitable as mining. It provides a more stable income source and is a less dangerous way of earning credits. Mission agents can be found in the field offices of all factions, and can be located in the map using the agent finder on the right side. These agents will give missions that provide credits and faction standing points.\nHauling\nHauling can be a consistent source of income in the early game, as hauling missions pay decently for beginner missions without the risk of dying that combat missions have, although it isn't recommended as the rewards are often very low. \nSpice Hauling\nHauling secure spice is a method to gain a steady income although it's unprofitable as you need to warp through dozens of systems to profit, another way to haul is the much riskier which is Syndicate spice hauling. You can do so at the risk of being pirated by other players. Wormhole/Frontier-Outpost hauling is the most profitable, but the need to travel and probe through wild space makes this form of hauling more of a gamble, though quite a lucrative one. With the cheapest hauler clocking in at 800 credits, doing only 2 basic hauler missions will more than cover the cost. \nFaction Supply Hauling\nTo support a warring faction, enlist in its embassy at the Citadel and haul supplies to gain credits and Loyalty Points. You can chose to haul basic faction supplies (which can be found in Staging Ground systems) and deliver them at non-stronghold system headquarters of your faction. This can be more profitable than spice hauling, as Faction Supplies are free.\nYou may also haul Trade Union supplies (obtainable in Harbor under the industrial station) and Syndicate supplies (obtainable in Syndica) to make more credits, although they won't give you any Loyalty Points. Keep in mind that this doesn't contribute to upgrading the system's HQ. This is much more lucrative than delivering a warring faction's supplies. Even better, you can do so without enlisting in any faction.\nThe further away the destination system is from where you got them, the more credits you will receive.\nOther Advice\nSee our list of tips here.\nIf you have any questions, check the FAQ before asking someone.",
