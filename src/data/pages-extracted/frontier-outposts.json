  "full_text": "Frontier Outposts\nThis article is about Frontier Outposts. You may be looking for Field Offices.\nFO Anomalies, also known as \"Frontier Outposts\" are Anomalies that have the letter code\"FO\" in their name. They are found in only Wild systems, and have a small Syndicate station (the outpost itself), along with an asteroid field of regular korrelite, with Syndicate fighters patrolling around the station. Drones do not spawn in the anomaly. These outposts are the only Syndicate stations known to feature turrets, housing 8 kinetic turrets on the Docking bay, and are also the only known place to find Syndicate fighters.\nInfo\n \nThe Outpost is not a normal space station, though it closely resembles other stations. You cannot spawn any ship except the one you entered the outpost with. They also do not contain any regular station modules found in normal stations. It has 4 total modules accessible from the main room, always including a Docking Bay and a Dockyard. The remaining two modules will be either the Shipyard, the Reactor, or the Drill. All rooms but the Docking Bay have no purpose other than being purely visual. \nInside the main room is a walkway around a massive asteroid, and right by the docking bay doors is the shop terminal, and two timers. The Restock Timer indicates when the shop inventory changes, and the Field Depletion Timer being when the anomaly despawns. The format for the Restock timer is HH:MM, whilst the Depletion timer is D:HH:MM.\nDocking Bay\n \nThe Docking Bay, aside from being different in shape and appearance from that of other stations, has 3 entrances/exits in a cross formation. The 4th direction is the door leading to the inside of the Outpost. There are landing light dot lines leading to each entrance. Inside the dock itself is a spacious room, with the door inside being elevated above the floor and 2 ramps leading up to it. The Ship spawning terminal does not open a menu, and upon interacting with it just spawns whichever ship you entered the Outpost with. There will be a Docking Bay in every Frontier Outpost.\nDockyard\n \nThe Dockyard is an empty room, with the entire wall across from the door being a window. This gives view to an array of what appear to be cargo containers. Underneath this room is a cargo dock, where you can buy and sell Spice from a spaceship. There will be a Dockyard in every Frontier Outpost. \nReactor\n \nThe Reactor contains a long vertical reactor core, which presumably powers the outpost. It features an octagon-shaped room, with an enclosed walkway around the reactor, having windows facing both in and out.\nShipyard\n \nThe Shipyard is an empty room with a \"window wall\", giving view to an enclosure that is holding an unmarked Jovian transport ship. It is not an actual ship, however, having no AI or health, and is merely a part of the station.\nDrill\n \nThe Drill room is a Room similar to the Reactor, but instead of a reactor sticking through it, it is a large laser drill. Beneath the station, the drill connects to an asteroid similar to the one in the center of the station which has some sort of cage around it to keep it in place.\nUsage\n\nAsteroid Field\n \nThe asteroids of Korrelite around the outpost can be mined as though they were a normal asteroid field. All of the asteroids will always be normal Korrelite (each piece of ore thus refining into 2 Korrelite). However, there are typically better options available for mining when you are out in Wild Space.\nShop\n \nInside the Outpost is an item shop which allows player to purchase various items for credits, including ships, furniture, weapons, armor, turrets, and modules. There are only so many items for sale; if you buy all of them, the shop will be empty until it restocks. The shop restocks once every 24 hours (the time remaining can be indicated by the restock timer), replacing any old items left in the shop with random new ones.\nGemstone Spice\n \nFrontier outposts are well known for their sales of Gemstone Spice, as they are one of two sources of them, the other being Wild SP anomalies. Which type of Gemstone Spice the Frontier Outpost sells depends on its location relative to the colored spice arcs; if an FO would fall in the blue spice arc, it will sell Sapphire spice, if yellow, then Amber, etc. The Cargo Dock for a Frontier Outpost is beneath the Dockyard module, as the center of the station, where the Cargo Dock usually is, is occupied by an asteroid. \nFrontier Outposts can be used in conjunction with Wormholes to transport large quantities of Gemstone spice across the galaxy, resulting in vast profits for the player. See WH/FO Hauling for more information.\nTrivia\nThese were added on 5/17/20 in the Scanning Probe Update along with the Solar System map and Tier 3 Monuments.\nIce miners used to be purchasable from FOs before they were officially added to the game. Prospecter turrets were also sold, but as this item never made it into the game officially, the few sold by FOs remain the only ones in existence.\nSnowballs used to be sold by FOs as well. Unlike the counterpart found in snow piles in stations during the Winter Update event, these snowballs were inventory items and could be placed in storage. They were very expensive and had no practical value, and throwing it uses it up.. There are some still in circulation.\nFOs were previously the only way to get Medium Tier 4 turrets, making them very rare and valuable. (All tier 4 turrets have since been removed, replaced by the 1-2-3-Exotic system).\nFrontier Outposts are often used in EVA glitches because they are the only way to use station gear in wild systems, and have thin walls, making it easy to glitch through.\nFOs were once glitched and able to spawn in secure systems. However, those ones were broken and did not sell anything on the shop menu or the spice dock. Both timers were stuck and did not go down.\nTurrets on FOs are Kinetic turrets (Railguns and Coilguns), while normal station turrets are Energy turrets (Beams and Cannons).",
