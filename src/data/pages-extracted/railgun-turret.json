Small ships such as Badger, Aurora, or Bison do not have S turret slots and cannot have S-turrets equipped. For the small autoturrets that some small ships have, see PDT.\nRailgun Turrets (Small)\nRailgun Turrets are turrets which deal a devastating amount of damage per shot, with an extremely slow fire rate, and a high velocity and range. These turrets have a low damage per second, due to their low fire rate. However, their high velocity, range, and damage make them exceptional for fighting at a distance. They are the kinetic alternate to Beam turrets.\nEssentially, they are snipers, but unlike with instantaneous Beam turrets, you need to lead your shots (predict where the target is going to be when the projectile hits).\nRailguns come in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Exotic variants. Railguns come in two Exotic variants: Dread and Ancient. These turrets have identical stats, but are obtained different ways; Ancient Railguns can only be found in X-Structures, whereas Dread Railguns need to be crafted from scrap, a Tier 3 Railgun, and a Dread Railgun blueprint, obtained from Dread Pirates and Pirate Dens.\nRailgun-M Turrets (Medium)\nRailgun-M turrets are very similar to their S variant. They have greater firepower and lower maneuverability. Medium turrets can only be equipped onto ships with Medium Turret Slots.\nRailgun-M turrets come in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Exotic variants. Coilgun-Ms come in two Exotic variants: Dread and Ancient. Dread and Ancient Railgun-Ms have identical stats, but are obtained different ways; Ancient Railgun-Ms can only be found in X-Structures, whereas Dread Railgun-Ms need to be crafted from scrap, a Tier 3 Railgun-M, and a Dread Railgun-M blueprint, obtained from Dread Pirates and Pirate Dens.\nManufacturing\nRailgun\nTier 1\n80 Korrelite, 60 Reknite, 40 Gellium\nTier 2\n40 Axnit, 20 Narcor, Railgun I\nTier 3\n20 Red Narcor, Railgun II\nDread\n100 Metal scraps, 10 Power cell, Railgun III, Dread Railgun blueprint\nAncient\nUncraftable\nRailgun-M\nTier 1\n160 Korrelite, 120 Reknite, 80 Gellium\nTier 2\n80 Axnit, 40 Narcor, Railgun-M I\nTier 3\n40 Red Narcor, Railgun-M II\nDread\n200 Metal scraps, 20 Power cell, Railgun-M III, Dread Railgun-M blueprint\nAncient\nUncraftable",
