  "full_text": "Gameplay\n\nOverview\nStarscape is a vast universe with many roles. You can hunt NPCs for loot drops, mine out asteroids for materials, haul supplies and trade spice for payment, fight for your nation's glory, and destroy other player ships for enjoyment and pay. This page will provide links covering the main moneymaking sources.\nMining\nMain Article: Mining\nMining is the process of harvesting raw ores from asteroids using mining vessels. Materials harvested through mining are essential to the game's economy, used to create modules, ships, and basically anything players will ever use. \nHauling\nMain Article: Hauling\nHauling is the process of shipping cargo crates filled with various items to and from locations with hauling vessels. Credits earned through mining are used for every aspect of market trading, and hauling is essential in Faction Warfare to create defenses.\nDrone Hunting\nMain Article: NPC Hunting\nDrone Hunting is a type of PvE, where a player searches for Drones in order to kill them for loot. Drones can be found in virtually every system, or in DH, BF, and SP Anomalies. Drone hunting is typically done in Wild Space, where the most Drones are present, at that, the more and most powerful, and offer the best loot table out of all system types.\nEnlisting in Factions\nMain Article: Enlisting\nPlayers can enlist in the faction's army by talking to a NPC in field offices who are located next to the terminal. Players can also enlist in contested systems by talking to an enlister that is located next to the terminal in a military faction field office or by talking to an enlister at the Citadel's embassies. By enlisting, players will not be able to damage their respective enlisted faction's NPC ships as well as other allied enlisted players in contested systems. Players can not resign from the army unless they have served for at least 24 hours.\nThe ranks that you can get by joining an NPC faction's military are:\nRank\nTitle (Lycentian)\nTitle (Foralkan)\nTitle\n(Kavani)\nRank unlocks\nPromotion Cost\nCumulative Promotion Cost\nPromotion Reward\nRank Icon (Lycentia)\nRank Icon (Foralkan)\nRank Icon (Kavani\n0\nPilot\n(PLT)\nPilot\n(PLT)\nPilot\n(PLT)\nFaction skins, faction uniform, faction symbol, military symbol, 55% insurance in contested systems\nN/A\n0 Lp\nN/A\n \n \n \n1\nEnsign\n(ENS)\nSub-lieutenant\n(SLT)\nMonitor\n(MTR)\nFaction weapon\n500 Lp\n500 Lp\nFaction holoprojector\n \n \n \n2\nLieutenant\n(LTN)\nLieutenant\n(LTN)\nCenturion\n(CTR)\n60% insurance in contested systems\n1,000 Lp\n1,500 Lp\nFaction banner\n \n \n \n3\nLieutenant Commander\n(LCM)\nSub-commander\n(SCM)\nJusticar\n(JTC)\nFaction fighter\n2,000 Lp\n3,500 Lp\nFaction weapon\n \n \n \n4\nCommander\n(CMD)\nCommander\n(CMD)\nPraefect\n(PFT)\nCommander/Prefect uniform, faction corvette blueprint, 65% insurance in contested systems\n3,500 Lp\n7,000 Lp\nFaction fighter\n \n \n \n5\nCaptain\n(CPT)\nCaptain\n(CPT)\nPraetor\n(PRA)\nFederal/Imperial/Sovereign skin, faction frigate blueprint\n5,500 Lp\n12,500 Lp\nFaction corvette\n \n \n \n6\nCommodore\n(COM)\nBrigadier General\n(BGD)\nCommandant\n(CDT)\nFaction destroyer blueprint, 70% insurance in contested systems, faction destroyer blueprint\n8,000 Lp\n20,500 Lp\nFaction frigate\n \n \n \n7\nAdmiral\n(ADM)\nAdmiral\n(ADM)\nMarshall\n(MCL)\nAdmiral/Marshall uniform, 75% insurance in contested system\n12,500 Lp\n33,000 Lp\nFaction destroyer\n \n \n ",
