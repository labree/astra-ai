Feel free to add your own ideas about the universe of Starscape here.\nDrone Theory (By Doglover218)\nDrones were once the heart of human civilization and our key protector, long before CoreSec. All of the known galaxy was once under one centralized power, with all Outer Rim threats neutralized by drone fleets that would scour the systems, protecting us. We used our advanced skills to create a few large capital ships, known now as drone battleships, and the heart of the operation, the mothership. The mothership controlled all modernized drones and used advanced algorithms to improve drone functions and designs, sending them to the drone miners and factories. We had created a Goliath, and with all that might, one thing started to go horribly wrong. With all the power we had amassed, we saw ourselves as invincible and overestimated the drone programming capabilities. Becoming cocky and careless, multiple gangs of civilians started firing at our own drone depots and foundry’s, just to see if they could get a reaction. Then someone got so stupid and careless that they destroyed a drone depot. Doing that sent a distress signal throughout every drone foundry, factory, depot, mega complex, fleet, and battleship, “Mayday Mayday, under attack by a new enemy. System: Gatinsir, Planet: 2. New Threat: Humans”. They had new orders, a new directive, a new goal to achieve, and it would cause one of the largest collapses of power the galaxy has ever seen. Countless convoys of fighters, corvettes, miners, and haulers started going missing, and those in frigates and destroyers returned shocked and traumatized. The drone fleets, once there to protect them, were pounding their ships with beams and lasers. All of what we currently know as Wild Space, was once secure systems, and syndicate was one of the major cities in those outer systems, and they were the only large scale survivors. All X Structures that are found are actually old remains of what used to be bustling stations and residences. The relays were the old warping systems, and the dockyards, which once held countless persons and haulers, now lay wrecked, pillaged, and in ruin. The ancient drones that you find in the functioning X Structures are the few drones that never received the command because they’re primitive systems with preset individualized orders and had not yet been set up to the centralized network. The fully functioning structures, with all their inhabitants, evacuated and left their homes, shops, and livelihoods behind, and kept their primitive ancient drones as a distraction as they made their escape. Most of the escapees were quickly destroyed by passing drone convoys, but a few groups somehow managed to escape, running to assist the defense of the remaining systems. What was once a tight human alliance, was now a mix of different factions fighting for their own goals and objectives, which brings us to the universe we live in now.\nFanmade Story (By ContraxiusTheContraband)\nIn the distant future as a professional explorer and a former Foralkan captain. The Foralkan Empire is one of the empires in the star cluster humanity lives in, known as The Core. Your next expedition takes place far beyond where civilization prospers, between the wild solar systems and the unclaimed and unexplored territory, where belligerent beings and hostile drones linger. Priceless asteroids yield more than those that are closer to The Core. In your galactic frigate, you send a system probe to seek out anomalies and aberrations when you stumble upon an aberration that indefinitely cycles a ringed planet. You charge your thrusters and beam through the hollow plane of space and warp to the aberration.\nAs you arrive and in the vast distance, you locate what is whispered as an ancient satellite relay. The desolate aberration appears to be in a fine condition regarding its obscure origins or the time it was assembled, or if humans even constructed it. Its colossal solar panels expand across the boundless abyss of the starry void. The satellite relay seems to be feeding off of the energy of the dead star in the center of the system for all of these eras. You use your technology to get more information. Your computer readings show it is unidentified. You cautiously approach the satellite relay to get a closer glimpse and notice an interactable panel. As you attempt to manually break into the satellite relay to grant access, you realize you will need to override the security system. After several attempts, you begin to recognize the patterns of the security lock and eventually override the security system. The satellite relay revealed a container that possessed an ancient beacon. There are theories of these primordial objects that existed but were lost and forgotten throughout time, but now you grasp the uncovered truth for yourself. As you extract the ancient beacon, the satellite relay’s failsafe has now been activated. It self-destructs and explodes. Pieces of the abandoned relic shatter into the debris of machinery and shards of solar panels that fly into deep space. Fortunately, the explosion was not big enough to deal damage to your frigate. It seems like the failsafe was activated due to the compromise of the ancient beacon.\nAfter examining the ancient beacon it divulged a map of a group of star systems and their spectral classes. Soon after deciphering the puzzle, you find the location of the star systems and journey across the region of wild systems called the Olivavan Expanse to the edge of space, evading hostile pirates and drones. After a prolonged voyage, you finally arrive at your designated system.\nSoon after exiting the warp, you arrive at a new aberration. Your computer chimes an alarm tone to indicate that the fire suppression system has been activated in the cargo hold. The ancient beacon you were carrying with you has vaporized. You accelerate ahead and take a closer look and discover a unique space station that corresponds to an intact X-structure. The architecture of these prehistoric establishments looked beautiful. The gargantuan aberration towered over you while orbiting its polychromatic jovian planet. The forlorn X-structure was solely accommodated by asteroids orbiting the Jovian planet in sync with the station. You encountered these aberrations before, but not like this. These forsaken ruins were not deserted and abandoned like the others. It was whole, entire, and seemed completely functional. After what felt like ages you finally find the closest thing to sentient life. Ancient drones revolving around the aberration seemed like they were defending the X-structure. The drones soon became aware of you and viewed you as a threat. With your modern-grade turrets, you fired back at them and effortlessly eradicated the drones. After the one-sided battle, the drones obviously stood no chance against your modern frigate, as you obliterated their hull. These drones were so primitive that they did not use any shield like present-day vessels. You plundered their remains, which solely had burnt power cells and ancient drone cores which had a much different design from the current drone cores.\nAfter the battle, you scour the X-structure. After a bit, you find a container and proceed to hack into the security of the container. You find a variety of rare ores and some technology for warships that you have never seen before. It resembled a railgun but it appeared foreign. The technology and machinery going into this turret were very basic and the mechanism was very unfamiliar compared to the railguns we currently use. You soon discover more of these containers and loot them. You find some more warship technology, rare materials, and some ancient modules for upgrading spacecraft. After some time you come down to the last container and take what's left of it. After looting the entire X-structure, it seems like it's time to return to the Core. After an eternal voyage, you travel back to The Core, avoiding hazards with cautiousness. You preserve your discovery a secret to attempt to uncover more about the history of these relics from the past, and soon enough you might find a discovery again.\nAfter your grand discovery of Ancient Satellite Relays and Intact X Structures. Being more cautious you spent some of your income from your prior discovery to construct yourself a Fortitude class destroyer. Destroyers are the most impeccable grade of warships that civilians can obtain. They are generally not as swift but the one that you acquired particularly excels at speed and damage, making it a sort of glass cannon. You dock your Fortitude at a docking bay from the Citadel Space Station. You slowly accelerate and overlook all the smaller spacecraft. With your Fortitude, you make your way to a warp relay which gives you access to warp to very distant systems. You jump from system to system and make your way to the edge of society. As you get closer to the unsecure systems, law enforcement is becoming rarer and you start to see more pirates appear. Soon enough you reach your first wild system where anarchy forms.\nAfter what felt like months from eradicating pirate dens to taking down drone factories you dock your Fortitude at a frontier outpost space station which is the safer area of wild systems. You cannot stall this journey so you proceed to explore a cluster of wild systems called Arkana. It was only a matter of time before you found an obscure anomaly. You hesitate to warp to the anomaly but you remember what you came here for. You decelerate after the warp drive and what you see is astonishing. The void around you feels dark and eerie, drained of all light except for the ominous shards of crystals pulsating with fluorescent chartreuse energy embedded in the asteroids that linger in this desolate abyss. Indigo thunder, cracks in random intervals but something else catches your eye. Several gargantuan crystalline shards of lapis blue rest in the distance of space but your computer identifies it as a sort of unknown lifeform. Out of curiosity, you try to mine the mysterious shards of chartreuse but as your mining beam hits the first asteroid, a wave of dread possesses your entire body, petrifying you. Your computer identifies the jagged crystalline shards of lapis as a threat. The creatures approach you while charging a bolt of cobalt lightning that spontaneously strikes your hull with might, nearly tearing off a piece of your Fortitude. It seems like they are guardians of the ores in this anomaly. You bolt away with swiftness and aim your turrets behind you. You charge your turrets with plasma to max capacity energy and exert all the power at once in a single direction. Your beams scrape across the threat, scorching and shredding the crystalline guardian and eventually, you rip one of these guardians in half with your beams. As more guardians approach you, your only option is to warp out of the anomaly.\nThroughout this journey, you destroyed a good amount of pirate dens which unfortunately meant you had a bounty on you. You were tracked down and a squad of 2 corvettes and 2 starfighters warped to your system. These assassins were relatively professional. While fighting them you kept at a good distance while using your beams to shred their hull from afar. You landed a good shot on the starfighter breaking open their cockpit and scorching the pilot. After enough time the assassin corvettes destroyed your shield but luckily you also destroyed an assassin corvette in return by puncturing a hole in their hull. You eventually obliterated the last starfighter and corvette but it was only a matter of time until the assassins sent frigates to hunt you down. You fled between the two wild system clusters called Eternity and Wildar to keep your profile low and maybe seek shelter at a frontier outpost.\nAfter exploring for a while you come across a system called Delta Anca which reveals another system available for warping called G-09. As you exit your warp drive the space around you feels drained and devoid of light very similar to the ambient environment in the previous anomaly. The same type of thunder seen in the previous anomaly also lingers here. In the distance, there are what look like ancient ruins of the past. There is a giant ring ahead of you that resembles a gateway. There were theories about these gates but were never confirmed until now. The gate itself appears to be destroyed, and there is an abundance of unidentified shipwrecks around the gate with a strange type of design compared to modern spacecraft. The shipwrecks consist of 3 capital ships and dozens of starfighters. The three capital ships are the only ships bearing nameplates, Blade of Perseus, Singularity, and Blue Space, respectively. You approach the Blade of Perseus and take a peek inside the broken hull ship. It looks like a dead crew floating motionless. In the distance, there is a broken planet and the crust is destroyed revealing the molten core which is not normal from what you’ve seen in the past. There is also an asteroid belt around the dead planet but it is very faint. Beyond the planet is what looks like a white dwarf. It had to be such a long time for a star to die since this gateway was here. You wonder how this could happen but the only realistic theory is that the crystalline guardians did this.\nYou warp back to the system Delta Anca but an ambush waits for you. 2 assassin frigates and 3 corvettes camp at the warp hub of Delta Anca. You use your beams and slice through a corvette but 4 more warships remain. You try to flee back to the core but they keep following you. The assassins disrupt your warp thrusters and start to destroy your shield but luckily you escape again. You start to get closer to the region called the Foralkan Empire. The assassins disrupt your warp once again but there are too many warships to fend off. Your hull is getting torn apart and you need a miracle to happen. Thankfully you lucked out, a Foralkan fleet warps to your system consisting of 3 destroyers and 13 corvettes. The destroyers aim their cannons at the assassin fleet and unleash all their might, the tables have turned and the assassins don't stand a chance. You refuge in the capital of the Foralkan Empire and debate with yourself whether you should put your discovery to light or keep it a mystery for everyone else.\nWhat the Materials really are (By YeetDaStratos)\nKorrelite= Iron/titanium, due to the usage in hulls irl and in-game\nReknite= Copper/gold, due to both being great electrical components, irl and ingame\nGellium= Chromium, because it is used as a coating, like chromium\nAxnit= Silicon, as both are used to make computer chips\n(Red) Narcor= Nickel ions, because Narcors are energetic substances, and nickel can be red and blue.\nVexnium= Exotic Matter due to the negative inertial field\nWater= Water (Duh)\nThe most logical lore theory (Mez)\n(Disclaimer! This is just a theory and put together with other peoples ideas)\nLets face it. You have looted an ancient beacon before and are guilty of killing ancient drones. If you have ever looked closely on the minimap, ancient drones appear a grey. The same as neutral NPC's. Time for lore.\nYears and years ago, prospiring factions did whatever. They enginereed drones to do their bidding. Now this story can take two turns from here. Also these two theories have the same ending.\nA.\nThe drones ventured far until they found vexnium and were corroded by it. This lead them to rebel against the human settlements, destroying them. Because vexnium is a very rare material, newer drones couldn't be engineered with it so now it’s just the normal drone plague etc and the vexnium guardians lost contact with the other drones due to corrosion. (Highly unlikely)\nB.\nMore likely, drones were engineered for the purpose of military, mining hauling etc. Now with all Sci-Fi films, theres always some new power that humans abuse and it turns on them. Lets just say its some sort of inter-universe wormhole rift thing. Humans abuse this new power to build stargates. Once humans open this portal, what is on the other side comes out. Vexnium gaurdians, once confined from the realm of myth have come through. Maybe humans start mining the vexnium and the gaurdians defend their sacred resource. Anyway, as this threat approaches the centre of the galaxy, drones are deployed to fend off these Vexnium creatures. Many are destroyed and damaged. Just by chance, a drone fleet commander get damaged and malfunctions. It now commands the remaining drones to attack the humans or something. A large number of drones still loyal to the original humans retreat to small structures hidden in planet rings and in the middle of no where. Desperate, the humans send their remaining fleets and important people to the stargates to survive. Either all the other fleets are destoryed before they get to gates 1-8 or make it through. What happens to the humans can follow either of these paths. (Since there are no remains of drones)\nA.\nThey commited genocide as the gate was closing fast\nB.\nThey were ambushed by Vexnium Gaurdians.\nNow what happened to any survivors, I do not know. But most likely the survivors either joined and made a secure CorSec to live peacefully, then factions hate on eachother etc and smaller communities make pirate dens and the syndicate. Due to the fact barely any humans are around anymore, humans have to rely on cloning.\nWow, writing this killed me... Anyway I have a team of lore enthusiests working on different things like going into a closing WH! (Timing this perfectly to go in right before it starts collapsing) any questions or you wanna join, DM me on Discord: mez_productions\nCya!\nPirates (by Bob bLowgan101t)\nPirates (npcs) are a collection of desperate poor people, ambitious nobles attempting to start their own nations (see: Captain Arwald on the AO wiki), and people who enjoy stealing and killing united under the same banner. they have their own technicians and auxiliaries in some secret place, and these scientsts come up with the Steeled and Dread equipment designs. they have outposts which they use for storage and as a base for raiding, often called Pirate Dens. They tend to think building their Dens inside of asteroids will help with protection, because no miner is going to be that heavily armed. They have a negative relationship with everyone, and they will even attack ships that can defeat them without thinking- if only as a desperate attempt to defend themselves from a potential attack.\nThe end!\nCreation of Vexnium\n(YeetDaStratos)\nIn the few thousand years after the big bang, Exotic Matter condensed into pieces of mass known as Vexnium Ore. It, being Exotic Matter, has a negative gravitational field, which is vital in stopping Destroyers and bigger from imploding. As galactic like Supernovas and Blace Holes increased, Vexnium became scarce, being found only in the far reaches of the galaxy, where there is little violent stellar activity. Crystalline Guardians, too were also found in distant reaches of the galaxy, and they enhanced themselves with it, and are hoarding all of it. This explains why they are so powerful, and why they are guarding it.\nCrystal Guardian Theory\n(Bob bLowgan101t)\nOk, so I have this theory, that the crystal guards are drones. That sounds crazy. I know.\nSo, once drones rebelled from humans, they came across a bit of vexnium. Curious, they experimented with it and made powerful ships- and then, started mass-producing them. However, their supply soon ran short, and they had to find more. So, they dispatched drones to mine out all the vexnium, which is why there is no vexnium in the core today. But then that supply ran out, and then, they made vexnium- enhanced drones go to wild systems, which 1. discouraged humans from going there, but also 2. allowed them to find more vex. What they did not know, however, is that vexnium actually corrupted ships, changing them using a crystalline fungus- but only in deposits of vexnium. this also corrupted the space around the ships, causing weird black spikes on mined-out vex asteroids, fog, and lightning. this happened to the ships mining and guarding the abandoned vex deposits, and ultimately the production of enhanced ships. but, the drones got greedy angain and wanted their old ships back. so, they developed a counter to vex corruption (drone cores), and tried to reclaim the lost mines. but that failed, and the art of vex- enhanced ships was taken by COREsec to make the hybrid ships. The reason the big ships were able to be built was a system that turned corruption into fuel for itself- so corruption was fueling the cleansing of corruption. the drones have been using artificial vex ever science, but it is less powerful and doesn't corrupt. Let's hope they never find out (lol).\nAncient Civilization Theory\n(ContraxiusTheContraband)\nWhat if the uncharted star gates are from a different galaxy or universe or something bigger and they came to our galaxy, the Starscape? They first arrived eons ago and their technology was not as advanced as ours, so they were too isolated and died off. Maybe something killed them, like the Crystalline Guardians. X-Structures have a unique type of architecture which does not look like the space stations we live in today. Maybe these people created drones and their technology was not as powerful as our modern technology, so their ancient drones had no shields. This theory could also explain the update known as Echoes of the Past, which added Ancient loot and beacons obtainable from X-Structures. \nExtinction of Humanity\n(Catto_Spooky#1105)\nHumanity as we know it today has not always been the same, it used to be a powerful species that ruled the universe. The years of prosperity and functioning were replaced by the Dark Ages. At first it seemed like a trivial problem. People in their pride and ignorance did not pay much attention to the warning from the scouts. But after they started listening, it was too late. The mighty Drone Fleets have sprung from the emptiness of space to the edge of the Terminus sector. People have experienced the reality of vulnerability as hundreds of worlds have fallen under the onslaught of attacking drones. A mound was formed that encircled the center of the galaxy. The ruling parties decided that they did not intend to live in the middle of the galaxy that once ruled, so they sent fleets that were to drive out and destroy the drones and eventually return triumphantly. But that did not happen. The fleet returned reduced in half, and to this end, a danger began to form at the border of the Wildar and Eternity sectors, which the explorers spoke of as a horror that is better left alone. In a panic, the government sent the remaining half of the fleet back from the expedition to destroy the threat. However, the fleet did not return, and worse, it revolted and established a Syndicate that tried to fight the drones, and the government. This failure contributed to the catastrophe that was to come. The horror was the Fortress, which contained the command protocols of all the drones and the ability to form mobile factories and complexes to produce the new generation of drones known today as ancient drones. A fleet of drones, estimated at up to one billion drones, launched an attack on the rampart. The incompetence and unstable background in wall politics caused by the plight of the three ruling families allowed the drones to quietly attack the center of the galaxy. the ruling families who fought against each other were three, Foralkan, Kavani and Lycentians. These families could not agree on a commanding structure. At this time, CoreSec was created and was given two tasks. The first was to clone the human race so that it could survive. The second was to close and delete from the location records and all gate information. They provided CoreSec with their genetic material to create these clones. Then they boarded ships that were to fly to another galaxy. However, their journey did not turn out well. In the system known today as the G-09, they were raided, and the subsequent overload of the gate generator caused an explosion that destroyed the gate itself but also the fleeing fleet. Today, the human race survives in the form of the Clones. However, another catastrophe is forming in space. Anomalies of mysterious material reeled by the crystal guards began to appear. However, it is not known whether they intend to attack or not, but if so, humanity will not do well\nX-Structure Theory(revamped as of 2024)\nZw0_C\nThe people who made the X-Structures and relating technology is us humans, in the form of an extinct race or unknown trace of ancestors.\nThe technology used by this faction/species is identical to our present one.\nLet me explain. Ancient turrets,rigs and subsystems can oddly fit and be used on modern ships without any issue(aside from exclusive size-based modules). This would normally be strange, since generally in sci-fi or reality it wouldn’t be this easily compatible unless another factor is involved. The factor is that we based our ships off them. This also applies to the other things you can fit. Otherwise how would you explain the coincidence that railguns and coilguns look identical and we also have Dread-tiered modules and weaponry that has equal footing as them?\nAs seen in the shipyard variant of the X-Structures, the ship wreckage inside the shipyard, when seen with toned down graphics, appears to have a docking port, and also circular shaped engines. We also use this technology, except we don’t use docking ports on small vessels like these. These ships have similar color schemes and design style which is not really far off if you could make an evolution chart from ancient ships to modern ships in an ascending manner.\nThe materials used does not play a huge part, but its very much possible the composition of materials in their ships should be about the same ratio as any equivalent vessel matching that unknown vessel’s size.\nDocking ports suggest that this unknown class of vessel could have docked at structures. The design of the docking port is the same if you could say that. The design is barely a change from ours, and its also present mostly at the centre of the vessel just like destroyers.\nIt should be noted that when we usually say ancient, it’s mostly us, but built a long time ago by some existing/dissolved power of humans. So this could hint at it being ancient human technology. However,alternatively,the meaning and purpose of the label “ancient” can vary. It doesn’t have to necessarily be ancient human, it could ancient alien or just Extra-Terrestrial(E.T) technology that has been confirmed to be very old. But the points i mention somewhat refute this alternate claim.\nThe Starscape Storyline\n(Sparkstorm2010)\nAfter piecing together lots of hints and lore I have come up with the best theory I could about the Starscape storyline. \nIt began over 10,000 years ago when the human race entered the system that starscape is set in, they began by building stations on the rings of planets and they slowly moved closer into the center of the galaxy. The humans came in 2 groups, each from different earth civilisations, they both came on different sides of the galaxy, one was known as the Kavani, the other known as the Lycentians. At the time these 2 factions were allied with each other and worked to build more stations on the rings. As they moved closer in their stations became more advanced, and they began to build the stations we know today. To gather the materials for these stations they used an army of drones made by their mechanics to harvest resources and fight off pirates who attempted to destroy them for resources. Everyone was going fine until, disaster struck. Almost all the drones were hacked by pirates attempting to destroy the factions and take all the resources. The civilisations sent their ships to try and cut the drones off from leaving the galaxy at the gates that they entered the system via, and after a long fight at Gate 9, they managed to cut them off. But in sending ships their, they left the old stations vulnerable, as the new ones have defensive guns to stop them from being destroyed. The drones that usually guard these stations began to fire at them, destroying almost all of them. All the few stations that were guarded by non hacked drones put their drones to maximum security, making them shoot everything that enters the area. These \"ancient drones\" will guard the untouched old stations forever. The civilisations then agreed to form Core-Sec, an organisation devoted to destroy the drones, and they build a new capital for the galaxy, the citadel. Around this time the syndicate popped up, formed by some of the pirates who the drones were fighting. Then, in Lycentia, a rebellion occurred, started by a general who had massive ambitions to be an emperor, and so the foralkan empire was formed. Kavani took this as their chance to take control of galaxy and attacked both the factions. Then, to try and continue industry during the chaos, the trade union to support the very few traders who still trade.\nSimple Lore\n(Unknown)\nWormhole to milky way collapsed so the people in the new galaxy is stuck, system gates are just warp relay prototypes, crystaline and drones are just rouge AI, vexnium is funky\nLore\n(Soviet Catto)\nStarscape lore is long. \nPre Core Civilisations\nThere once was a civilisation, who lived long ago, before guardians, drones or our current species. Their homeworld was named Earth. It is located in what nowdays is Foralkan Empire, Harvest, Secure Belt line planet 4. Now, you might ask why if you search Earth up you cant find it on the starscape map? I'll explain. The first humans used eon-ships which took generations to hop from star to star. They quickly took over all of harvest and were multiplying like rats. They were faced with a overpopulation crisis which forced them to expand and expand. With so many people and so many minds, who knows what they could invent? Galaxy destroying weapons? rare minerals and ships?\nNo. There was a corporation called Earco Ind. (Earth coalition industrial sector) which made a groundbreaking acheivement, drones. They used their headquaters on earth to make drones and controller pods. Essentialy, people plugged themselves into the machine and autonomously controlled a drone. This quickly spread the economical sector as more and more miners were recruited. The neighbouring galaxies seeing earth's acheivements and skills invited them to the IGA (Inter Galactical Alliance) Earth gladly accepted. Years passed with no major news until one fateful day, the destroyer class ship was concepted. It needed a rare mineral only found in far flung corners of the galaxy. That rescource was extremly limited and the entire galaxy only had 200KG of it. It was crucial to the construction of destroyers and was utilized immideantly. That rescource was Vexnium.\nThe other members got jealous and asked earth to trade. Earth profusely declined so as punishment, the other factions sent in crystal guardians, the most advanced ships of the time. They hoarded the vexnium so earth went on strike causing the GIGW (Great Inter-Galactic War) which lead to the destruction of G-09. There were nine gates and each of them led to neighbouring galaxies. The leader of the alliance Yunavithon, was linked to the starscape galxy by G-09. They blew up the gate, quarantined the other systems in their galaxies and cut the spacelanes. As their last act of the war, they blew up the capital Earth. Due to the fact the HQ of Earco Ind was blown up, all the sentient beings could not escape their shells, the drones. They migrated to the edges of the galaxy constantly bombarding the gates but all hope was lost.\nThe Expansion Age\nIn the 1st Galactican Standard Year (year 0 started as the first colonial ship exited Concord) marked the beggining of the race we are. Quickly colonising the neighbouring systems Bastion, Triage, Sheild, Aegis and Guard. The first ships sent were all Eon-ships, meant for generations upon generations to slowly migrate towards other systems. Hence, the Eon ships not knowing much about their homeland started their own civilisations. After many generations, a groundbreaking technology was created. Only seen in Sci-Fi movies, warping/hyperdrive was always a fantasy. But now it had come true. This invention was like the wheel, an invention that no matter what you would come across. Once all the systems gained this technology, hell was unleashed. All this time the humans grew further and further apart until the year 12037, when a certain young man took initiative and became the one who settled their differences and finally brought peace. This was a golden age for the Core, and together in teamwork and friendship set up the first station in the Citadel, a hub for all their systems.\nAfter many more eons, the relatively isolationist core had slowly emerged out of their shell and started colonising and discovering other systems. This process was further boosted by the cloning technology that led to even faster colonialization. Soon, their warp technology was so good that the MKII version of the warp could travel between systems in 2 months! But, there was far more danger ahead. They had discovered the drones, which mistook them for the enemies that blew their home planet up, became enraged and started massacring the colonies. After a few decades of war, the Core systems finally emerged victorious, banishing the drones away from the inner core. They also founded the organisation COR-SEC which defended the people from the incursions of drones. The drones also started adapting, and making new drones too. \nAfter the victory, Cor-Sec started a initiative to expand further and to create a Vassal-like body. It was compulsory for many citizens but not everyone was happy going away from their homes to a far-away wasteland. Some escaped and lived off alien planets while hiding from the drones. One such of these groups was the Kavans. They migrated west to a system called Vanos. The aliens there were quite similar to humans thus creating a new species called Kavani Humans. They stayed quiet, beliving in a Mandate sent from heaven that protected them from all enemies. That was the First Mandate. Some other groups went out and became pirates, hateful of Cor-Sec and tempted by the rewards. The colony eventually outgrew Cor-Sec and became the Lycentinian Federation.\nSoon after, the Lycentinians declared its independance from Cor-Sec and achieved full autonomy. With this new power, they started to expand at a high rate. Soon, they were encroaching on Kavani territory, not knowing they were there. This outraged the population, and one ambitious young man changed that. Beliving the heavens gave them a second mandate, giving them more territory. The Kavani's left their shell and started manufacturing ships for what they belived 'The Purge' would happen. It did.\nThe Lycentinians declared war on the Kavani Mandate causing turmoil across both nations. Sensing instability, the young Foralkus the First, Head of the South Front and leader of the Hippa Vassal State, declared independance under Kavani cover. The Lycentinians were overwhelmed and the Foralkans achieved their independance.\nAlthough the Kavani-Foralkan alliance did not last, and all three nations broke out in war, this was a relatively peaceful time. A group of rich pirates decided to start their own enterprice, called the Syndicate while setting up base in wild space, far far away from Cor-Sec's grasp. This immensly powerful Faction was not one of war, but one of Economy. They sold rare Spice (kinda like britain) and earned a buck load of money. Attempting to combat this, Cor-Sec setup a Secure based Faction called the Trade Union. The two companies fought limb to limb and toe to toe to get more profit than the other. This, helped the entire galaxy to rise in power and economy.\nPresent\nNow, as more citizens are being allowed by Cor-Sec to start going into space and earning money, the economy is thriving better than ever. As a symbol of prosperity, Cor-Sec rebuilt the Citadel station into a trading enterprise like we've never seen before. It had 3 levels, one for ships and factions to base in, one for refining and one purely built for socialisation and trading.\nCor-Sec has started one of many projects, to further enhance the economy and take advantage of the Wild's rescources has started building hyperjump lanes which propell you several systems at a time. The factions also made their own private wild mining sectors to one up each other. \nFuture\nOne day, us players can afford to start our own stations, one which we could base our faction in to get more power and grip of this constantly changing galaxy. Maybe one day we could discover even better technologies and better ships. Maybe one day we would be invited to the Inter-Galactical Alliance again. Who knows?\nYesterday is history. Tommorow is a mystery, and today is a gift. That's why they call it a present. - Oogway\nuhm, they actually call it present not a present! -Nerd\nAuthor’s Theories (Justin Bledsaw/t3ssrhackd)\nAs an aspiring young author and storyteller, I have decided to put together some theories about the game. This is based on other people’s theories somewhat, and a bit of my own spin on some things.\nG Systems hypothesis is overused, so I won’t go over that.\nWormhole Hypothesis\nIf the Starscape Galaxy is in the real universe, civilization likely exists from a wormhole that connected the Milky Way to this galaxy.\nPossibly a decent-sized group of humans built the Citadel around a Neptunian gas giant, suitable for station building and resource harvesting. Due to realizing how inbreeding could work out due to the founder effect1, they invested in cloning technology, biotech, and genetic tampering. This way, humanity could survive and potentially quadrillions of people would be born and diffuse across the galaxy, thanks to the efforts of this group.\nI believe a wormhole would have done it because we don’t necessarily know how to map another galaxy with our current technology, and our galaxy mainly has estimates. Intergalactic travel would be ridiculous, possibly spanning thousands of generations at warp speed, and even cells would probably expire if we were frozen to travel that distance.\nAlternate Reality Hypothesis\nIf the Starscape Galaxy is not in the real universe, humanity likely evolved at a central point and as it got more advanced, spread through the galaxy.\nAssume that humans evolved over time, the same events transpiring as what would happen in Earth theories. This goes against my faith, but I’ll stick with it for this theory. Perhaps they evolved close to the star where the Citadel station would be based, and eventually when they got there made the Citadel as an interstellar colonization hub.\nWhen the governance of their administration, probably later CoreSec, was too overstretched, civilizations such as Lycentia and Kavanos would form. Humanity would continue to spread throughout the galaxy and fill what would be Secure space.\nNotes\nThe Founder Effect is when a small population of organisms is isolated. Over time, their descendants have less genetic diversity and this potentially could lead to the population being wiped out due to a drastic environmental change, or birth defects occurring in the population.\nrandom stuff i thinkeying\nthings i think\nVenexium guards are just venexium at such large quantity that i gained sentience and is protecting the vex to let more vex guards grow\npirates are hoomans that ate venexium\ncoresec is lazy\nlore i think\nhoomans went and colonised in faction space as of this time core space was just a big star\nbig star went boom and hoomans evacuated thru the gates which the hoomans built cuz they knew star will go boom\nafter boom hoomans sent ancient drones thru g-09 to colonise and make the citedel in the newly empty center of the galaxy and a cloning facility there to make hoomans\nold hoomans couldnt re-open gates so ancient drones didnt have a control signal anymore so when they went to the gates no one was there to take them back so since they had no control signal they just patroled the old hoomans stuctures\nnew hoomans colonised faction space and found some old mining platforms and stations mining rare stuff so they got contested over\nnew hoomans broke into 2 factions kavvie and brickie\nnew hoomans made coresec to stop them from killing each other in the core, go kill eachother somewhere else!\nold hoomans tried to come thru g-09 but got blown up by ancient drones which blew up the planet and gate in the process of dieing\nancient drones evolved into drones and made megacomplexes to control them near the gates\nThe Citadel is the Solar System\n(IndominusTime3000)\nAlthough, Citadel is our home, we do not see 8 planets and only two, and one planet called Citadel is possible to be called Neptune, but the planet's name probably changed after a moon named Triton collided with Neptune. This planet got the rings as big as Saturn's. However, the rest of the planets were not visible due to The Citadel/Solar System Sun being a Core System. However, another planet named Bantam around 3 AU which is possibly Ceres. Bantam has asteroid fields like our solar system's. Earth has no asteroid fields or space stations, which is probably why Earth is not placed in. The stars spectral class is apparently F type, but because the Sun is G2V, it is considered the coolest F-type star. Regular Humans have not went extinct yet, but about 1/10 of the population live in the station and clone in the Citadel Space Station.\nHere is how the Factions occur. In 2123, the drones attack Earth that were created by Pirates that hated Earth. Some hero teams decided to make a squad named CoreSec, but eventually turned into a faction. Then certain military forces decided to take on for Lycentian, Kavini, and Foralkian and they are enemies to each other. Trade Union turned to the biggest market for outer space, while Syndicate used to be part of CoreSec, but then CoreSec attacked Syndicate and was thought Syndicate was gone, however, Syndicate is currently now in the wild system. Over time, Earth still have regular people with the system being secured and the citadel space station planet neptune/citadel and Earth is currently a home. \nThe Drones and The Pirates (By IndominusTime3000)\nAround the 2100, the drones were created by the Pirates that were humans that hated Earth. When the pirates made the drones, the pirates sended off the drones to attack Earth. However, after CoreSec removed all the drones created by pirates. CoreSec made drones to patrol, however, all were hacked by pirates, then created drone factories and then fleets to keep the drone reproducing, but the problem begins as the Pirates accidentally hack to not be hackable anymore and destroy all humans including Pirates, drones start attacking pirates and eventually, these evil robot will take on the world. Also, a gated system number 10/G-10(NotREAL/Hypothetical), has a drone megagiantfactory that creates drone cruisers, drone destroyers, and battleships that were made my drone commanders(command frigates). Now Pirates made a den, so that some weak pirates have a small little asteroid home that is secured by many Pirates and it depends on the size to change the designs and how strong they are. Now, as we know, the Prates and the Drones are enemies, but will we find out what really caused it. Also, some drones sneak into secure systems which will eventaully be defeated, however, they are light variants because these light variants can only steal certain materials and usually are designed to be the weakest.\nThe Gated Systems of G-01-G-08(IndominusTime3000)\nWe know that these gated systems only have dark nebula and debris. However, we can see a star pulsing or forming. It can either running out of fuel, or it could have been a very young o-type main sequence star. We still do not know if any evidence of these stars are provided.\nThe Other Systems(IndominusTime3000)\nAlthough we are in the center of the galaxy in the game, there is only around 3000 systems in the game compared to a hundred thousand in the Milky Way, which explains why some stars like Alpha Centauri and Sirius which are closer than 10 lightyears away did not show up as they did not have exoplanets and very few stars we discovered had exoplanets and had showed up. However, the edges of the systems in the game is only at a small fraction in the Milky Way galaxy still. There are no o-type main sequence stars in the game due to not having planets.\nThe Failed Experiment Theory (Luckynathan07)\nThere is lots of proof of some sort of ancient civilisation in Starscape lore, most notably in the existence of X-Structures, Gates, and other relics of the past. This ancient civilisation expanded large and far, all over the charted and uncharted Starscape galaxy, and this may have been the first civilisation to inhabit the galaxy. However, with the drones also being shown as fairly old in historical terms (especially with the existence of Ancient Drones), a theory may be made about the drones being the same age of this ancient civilisation, and possibly what caused the apparent extinction of this civilisation. Now, how exactly would drones even emerge to cause something on this scale? Well, this theory states that drones were actually a scientific invention created by the ancient civilisation, likely for automation and resource collection. However, everything changed when the drones were also programmed to reproduce, in drone depots. As drones became more intelligent overtime due to their programming, they came to learn how to create drone depots, and created more across the galaxy, including foundries, factories, and megacomplexes. At this point, drones were more powerful than the ancient civilisation that created them, and thus they rebelled, sparking an ancient war between the two. This likely led to mass panic and pandemonium admist the ancient civilisation, leading to many attempting to escape through the Galactic Gates (G-01 through to G-09). As the war continued, drones learned of the position of one of these gates - G-09, and ended up destroying three ships whilst a crew was attempting to escape, destroying the Gate as well as the ships of the Blade of Perseus, Blue Space, and Singularity. As can be seen from the wreckage of G-09, the Blade of Perseus' crew can be seen, and their armor and body shape resembles humans, possibly meaning that this ancient civilisation was humanoid in some way, and originated from a habitable planet inside of the galaxy. Despite this, they ended up almost entirely losing the war, with only a small fraction of systems being secure, the Core systems of the Citadel, Guard, Aegis, Concord, Bastion, Triage, and Shield. After maintaining these systems and protecting them from the drones, CoreSEC was founded to be humanity's last stand against drones, and they ended up slowly covering the Inner Core. After this, it is possible that the two older military factions, the Lycentian Federation and the Kavani Mandate formed, although their origins as either ex-CoreSEC members or seperate species of humanoids is unclear, as both of their capitals are habitable planets.\nLycentian covert ops transmission\nTo: Evan\nFrom: Synara\n27/11/04\nHey,\nThe mandate just came up with a cruiser that is much stronger than I thought. I've planted the plasma charges, but I don't think they will do much considering the sheer strength of that thing. Worse, they're planning on giving these out to the enlisted, which means if they die they get it back. Now, I did take a blueprint, and I made it as obvious as possible so maybe they'll cancel the project. I'm being pursued, but I hope for our sake the Annihallator will never see service.\nIts all we can do.\nThe pirate and CoreSec theory (by Coastalwar718, inspired by Doglover218's Drone theory)\nThe separation of drones from humanity had unforeseen consequences. Many people died, even more people were left without a place to call home after the abandonement and pillagement of the X-structures. There were two major leagues afterwards: those who wanted to restore humanity's power through organisation and unity (later known as CoreSec), and those who wanted to use the chaos that had erupted for their own good. \nBoth of these factions started off as small groups of people who tried to spread their ideology further and further. The first of two groups had more resources, since they most likely were major political/military figures, which had more power than ordinary people. At some point, they've had a breakthrough in cloning technology, using their services to further fund their operations. They came together and started slowly pushing drones away from the center of the galaxy, and the very fist space station that they've built by themselves was at that very center. They've named it \"The Citadel\". \nAfter a bit of time, however, it became more and more clear that drones weren't the only problem they had to face. The latter of the two groups described, later known as the Pirates, have also started to unite and gain power. They didn't have the resources of the people behind the newly-formed organisation, so they were forced to use more primitive measures, such as making their space stations and bases out of asteroids. That is also the reason most of their ships can be seen in a much worse state than their brand new, well-maintained counterparts. Those ships have started to decay due to the disrepair and mistreatment they were forced to endure, and thus, have started to lose performance and look like rust buckets. But it doesn't mean that the pirates aren't a threat. Although they didn't have quality, the sheer number of their ships that was left over from the remains of the civilization made them a formidable and risky opponent to fight. \nAs CoreSec continued to push drones back and gain power and people from doing so, pirates have become more and more frequent, as they remained on the outskirts of the galaxy, reinforcing their positions in the wild and unsecure systems. After some point, CoreSec deemed the recovery and stabilization of the entire galaxy unnecesary and expensive, both in terms of resources and lives, so they've instead focused on keeping whatever they had already captured. And that brings us to today, with solar systems close to the center being safe and peaceful, and the outskirts being the battlegrounds of the drones and pirates.",

        "content": "Drones were once the heart of human civilization and our key protector, long before CoreSec. All of the known galaxy was once under one centralized power, with all Outer Rim threats neutralized by drone fleets that would scour the systems, protecting us. We used our advanced skills to create a few large capital ships, known now as drone battleships, and the heart of the operation, the mothership. The mothership controlled all modernized drones and used advanced algorithms to improve drone functions and designs, sending them to the drone miners and factories. We had created a Goliath, and with all that might, one thing started to go horribly wrong. With all the power we had amassed, we saw ourselves as invincible and overestimated the drone programming capabilities. Becoming cocky and careless, multiple gangs of civilians started firing at our own drone depots and foundry’s, just to see if they could get a reaction. Then someone got so stupid and careless that they destroyed a drone depot. Doing that sent a distress signal throughout every drone foundry, factory, depot, mega complex, fleet, and battleship, “Mayday Mayday, under attack by a new enemy. System: Gatinsir, Planet: 2. New Threat: Humans”. They had new orders, a new directive, a new goal to achieve, and it would cause one of the largest collapses of power the galaxy has ever seen. Countless convoys of fighters, corvettes, miners, and haulers started going missing, and those in frigates and destroyers returned shocked and traumatized. The drone fleets, once there to protect them, were pounding their ships with beams and lasers. All of what we currently know as Wild Space, was once secure systems, and syndicate was one of the major cities in those outer systems, and they were the only large scale survivors. All X Structures that are found are actually old remains of what used to be bustling stations and residences. The relays were the old warping systems, and the dockyards, which once held countless persons and haulers, now lay wrecked, pillaged, and in ruin. The ancient drones that you find in the functioning X Structures are the few drones that never received the command because they’re primitive systems with preset individualized orders and had not yet been set up to the centralized network. The fully functioning structures, with all their inhabitants, evacuated and left their homes, shops, and livelihoods behind, and kept their primitive ancient drones as a distraction as they made their escape. Most of the escapees were quickly destroyed by passing drone convoys, but a few groups somehow managed to escape, running to assist the defense of the remaining systems. What was once a tight human alliance, was now a mix of different factions fighting for their own goals and objectives, which brings us to the universe we live in now."

        "content": "In the distant future as a professional explorer and a former Foralkan captain. The Foralkan Empire is one of the empires in the star cluster humanity lives in, known as The Core. Your next expedition takes place far beyond where civilization prospers, between the wild solar systems and the unclaimed and unexplored territory, where belligerent beings and hostile drones linger. Priceless asteroids yield more than those that are closer to The Core. In your galactic frigate, you send a system probe to seek out anomalies and aberrations when you stumble upon an aberration that indefinitely cycles a ringed planet. You charge your thrusters and beam through the hollow plane of space and warp to the aberration.\nAs you arrive and in the vast distance, you locate what is whispered as an ancient satellite relay. The desolate aberration appears to be in a fine condition regarding its obscure origins or the time it was assembled, or if humans even constructed it. Its colossal solar panels expand across the boundless abyss of the starry void. The satellite relay seems to be feeding off of the energy of the dead star in the center of the system for all of these eras. You use your technology to get more information. Your computer readings show it is unidentified. You cautiously approach the satellite relay to get a closer glimpse and notice an interactable panel. As you attempt to manually break into the satellite relay to grant access, you realize you will need to override the security system. After several attempts, you begin to recognize the patterns of the security lock and eventually override the security system. The satellite relay revealed a container that possessed an ancient beacon. There are theories of these primordial objects that existed but were lost and forgotten throughout time, but now you grasp the uncovered truth for yourself. As you extract the ancient beacon, the satellite relay’s failsafe has now been activated. It self-destructs and explodes. Pieces of the abandoned relic shatter into the debris of machinery and shards of solar panels that fly into deep space. Fortunately, the explosion was not big enough to deal damage to your frigate. It seems like the failsafe was activated due to the compromise of the ancient beacon.\nAfter examining the ancient beacon it divulged a map of a group of star systems and their spectral classes. Soon after deciphering the puzzle, you find the location of the star systems and journey across the region of wild systems called the Olivavan Expanse to the edge of space, evading hostile pirates and drones. After a prolonged voyage, you finally arrive at your designated system.\nSoon after exiting the warp, you arrive at a new aberration. Your computer chimes an alarm tone to indicate that the fire suppression system has been activated in the cargo hold. The ancient beacon you were carrying with you has vaporized. You accelerate ahead and take a closer look and discover a unique space station that corresponds to an intact X-structure. The architecture of these prehistoric establishments looked beautiful. The gargantuan aberration towered over you while orbiting its polychromatic jovian planet. The forlorn X-structure was solely accommodated by asteroids orbiting the Jovian planet in sync with the station. You encountered these aberrations before, but not like this. These forsaken ruins were not deserted and abandoned like the others. It was whole, entire, and seemed completely functional. After what felt like ages you finally find the closest thing to sentient life. Ancient drones revolving around the aberration seemed like they were defending the X-structure. The drones soon became aware of you and viewed you as a threat. With your modern-grade turrets, you fired back at them and effortlessly eradicated the drones. After the one-sided battle, the drones obviously stood no chance against your modern frigate, as you obliterated their hull. These drones were so primitive that they did not use any shield like present-day vessels. You plundered their remains, which solely had burnt power cells and ancient drone cores which had a much different design from the current drone cores.\nAfter the battle, you scour the X-structure. After a bit, you find a container and proceed to hack into the security of the container. You find a variety of rare ores and some technology for warships that you have never seen before. It resembled a railgun but it appeared foreign. The technology and machinery going into this turret were very basic and the mechanism was very unfamiliar compared to the railguns we currently use. You soon discover more of these containers and loot them. You find some more warship technology, rare materials, and some ancient modules for upgrading spacecraft. After some time you come down to the last container and take what's left of it. After looting the entire X-structure, it seems like it's time to return to the Core. After an eternal voyage, you travel back to The Core, avoiding hazards with cautiousness. You preserve your discovery a secret to attempt to uncover more about the history of these relics from the past, and soon enough you might find a discovery again.\nAfter your grand discovery of Ancient Satellite Relays and Intact X Structures. Being more cautious you spent some of your income from your prior discovery to construct yourself a Fortitude class destroyer. Destroyers are the most impeccable grade of warships that civilians can obtain. They are generally not as swift but the one that you acquired particularly excels at speed and damage, making it a sort of glass cannon. You dock your Fortitude at a docking bay from the Citadel Space Station. You slowly accelerate and overlook all the smaller spacecraft. With your Fortitude, you make your way to a warp relay which gives you access to warp to very distant systems. You jump from system to system and make your way to the edge of society. As you get closer to the unsecure systems, law enforcement is becoming rarer and you start to see more pirates appear. Soon enough you reach your first wild system where anarchy forms.\nAfter what felt like months from eradicating pirate dens to taking down drone factories you dock your Fortitude at a frontier outpost space station which is the safer area of wild systems. You cannot stall this journey so you proceed to explore a cluster of wild systems called Arkana. It was only a matter of time before you found an obscure anomaly. You hesitate to warp to the anomaly but you remember what you came here for. You decelerate after the warp drive and what you see is astonishing. The void around you feels dark and eerie, drained of all light except for the ominous shards of crystals pulsating with fluorescent chartreuse energy embedded in the asteroids that linger in this desolate abyss. Indigo thunder, cracks in random intervals but something else catches your eye. Several gargantuan crystalline shards of lapis blue rest in the distance of space but your computer identifies it as a sort of unknown lifeform. Out of curiosity, you try to mine the mysterious shards of chartreuse but as your mining beam hits the first asteroid, a wave of dread possesses your entire body, petrifying you. Your computer identifies the jagged crystalline shards of lapis as a threat. The creatures approach you while charging a bolt of cobalt lightning that spontaneously strikes your hull with might, nearly tearing off a piece of your Fortitude. It seems like they are guardians of the ores in this anomaly. You bolt away with swiftness and aim your turrets behind you. You charge your turrets with plasma to max capacity energy and exert all the power at once in a single direction. Your beams scrape across the threat, scorching and shredding the crystalline guardian and eventually, you rip one of these guardians in half with your beams. As more guardians approach you, your only option is to warp out of the anomaly.\nThroughout this journey, you destroyed a good amount of pirate dens which unfortunately meant you had a bounty on you. You were tracked down and a squad of 2 corvettes and 2 starfighters warped to your system. These assassins were relatively professional. While fighting them you kept at a good distance while using your beams to shred their hull from afar. You landed a good shot on the starfighter breaking open their cockpit and scorching the pilot. After enough time the assassin corvettes destroyed your shield but luckily you also destroyed an assassin corvette in return by puncturing a hole in their hull. You eventually obliterated the last starfighter and corvette but it was only a matter of time until the assassins sent frigates to hunt you down. You fled between the two wild system clusters called Eternity and Wildar to keep your profile low and maybe seek shelter at a frontier outpost.\nAfter exploring for a while you come across a system called Delta Anca which reveals another system available for warping called G-09. As you exit your warp drive the space around you feels drained and devoid of light very similar to the ambient environment in the previous anomaly. The same type of thunder seen in the previous anomaly also lingers here. In the distance, there are what look like ancient ruins of the past. There is a giant ring ahead of you that resembles a gateway. There were theories about these gates but were never confirmed until now. The gate itself appears to be destroyed, and there is an abundance of unidentified shipwrecks around the gate with a strange type of design compared to modern spacecraft. The shipwrecks consist of 3 capital ships and dozens of starfighters. The three capital ships are the only ships bearing nameplates, Blade of Perseus, Singularity, and Blue Space, respectively. You approach the Blade of Perseus and take a peek inside the broken hull ship. It looks like a dead crew floating motionless. In the distance, there is a broken planet and the crust is destroyed revealing the molten core which is not normal from what you’ve seen in the past. There is also an asteroid belt around the dead planet but it is very faint. Beyond the planet is what looks like a white dwarf. It had to be such a long time for a star to die since this gateway was here. You wonder how this could happen but the only realistic theory is that the crystalline guardians did this.\nYou warp back to the system Delta Anca but an ambush waits for you. 2 assassin frigates and 3 corvettes camp at the warp hub of Delta Anca. You use your beams and slice through a corvette but 4 more warships remain. You try to flee back to the core but they keep following you. The assassins disrupt your warp thrusters and start to destroy your shield but luckily you escape again. You start to get closer to the region called the Foralkan Empire. The assassins disrupt your warp once again but there are too many warships to fend off. Your hull is getting torn apart and you need a miracle to happen. Thankfully you lucked out, a Foralkan fleet warps to your system consisting of 3 destroyers and 13 corvettes. The destroyers aim their cannons at the assassin fleet and unleash all their might, the tables have turned and the assassins don't stand a chance. You refuge in the capital of the Foralkan Empire and debate with yourself whether you should put your discovery to light or keep it a mystery for everyone else."

If you have ever looked closely on the minimap, ancient drones appear a grey. The same as neutral NPC's. Time for lore.\nYears and years ago, prospiring factions did whatever. They enginereed drones to do their bidding. Now this story can take two turns from here. Also these two theories have the same ending.\nA.\nThe drones ventured far until they found vexnium and were corroded by it. This lead them to rebel against the human settlements, destroying them. Because vexnium is a very rare material, newer drones couldn't be engineered with it so now it’s just the normal drone plague etc and the vexnium guardians lost contact with the other drones due to corrosion. (Highly unlikely)\nB.\nMore likely, drones were engineered for the purpose of military, mining hauling etc. Now with all Sci-Fi films, theres always some new power that humans abuse and it turns on them. Lets just say its some sort of inter-universe wormhole rift thing. Humans abuse this new power to build stargates. Once humans open this portal, what is on the other side comes out. Vexnium gaurdians, once confined from the realm of myth have come through. Maybe humans start mining the vexnium and the gaurdians defend their sacred resource. Anyway, as this threat approaches the centre of the galaxy, drones are deployed to fend off these Vexnium creatures. Many are destroyed and damaged. Just by chance, a drone fleet commander get damaged and malfunctions. It now commands the remaining drones to attack the humans or something. A large number of drones still loyal to the original humans retreat to small structures hidden in planet rings and in the middle of no where. Desperate, the humans send their remaining fleets and important people to the stargates to survive. Either all the other fleets are destoryed before they get to gates 1-8 or make it through. What happens to the humans can follow either of these paths. (Since there are no remains of drones)\nA.\nThey commited genocide as the gate was closing fast\nB.\nThey were ambushed by Vexnium Gaurdians.\nNow what happened to any survivors, I do not know. But most likely the survivors either joined and made a secure CorSec to live peacefully, then factions hate on eachother etc and smaller communities make pirate dens and the syndicate. Due to the fact barely any humans are around anymore, humans have to rely on cloning.\nWow, writing this killed me...

I know.\nSo, once drones rebelled from humans, they came across a bit of vexnium. Curious, they experimented with it and made powerful ships- and then, started mass-producing them. However, their supply soon ran short, and they had to find more. So, they dispatched drones to mine out all the vexnium, which is why there is no vexnium in the core today. But then that supply ran out, and then, they made vexnium- enhanced drones go to wild systems, which 1. discouraged humans from going there, but also 2. allowed them to find more vex. What they did not know, however, is that vexnium actually corrupted ships, changing them using a crystalline fungus- but only in deposits of vexnium. this also corrupted the space around the ships, causing weird black spikes on mined-out vex asteroids, fog, and lightning. this happened to the ships mining and guarding the abandoned vex deposits, and ultimately the production of enhanced ships. but, the drones got greedy angain and wanted their old ships back. so, they developed a counter to vex corruption (drone cores), and tried to reclaim the lost mines. but that failed, and the art of vex- enhanced ships was taken by COREsec to make the hybrid ships. The reason the big ships were able to be built was a system that turned corruption into fuel for itself- so corruption was fueling the cleansing of corruption. the drones have been using artificial vex ever science, but it is less powerful and doesn't corrupt. Let's hope they never find out (lol)."

They first arrived eons ago and their technology was not as advanced as ours, so they were too isolated and died off. Maybe something killed them, like the Crystalline Guardians. X-Structures have a unique type of architecture which does not look like the space stations we live in today. Maybe these people created drones and their technology was not as powerful as our modern technology, so their ancient drones had no shields. This theory could also explain the update known as Echoes of the Past, which added Ancient loot and beacons obtainable from X-Structures. "

The years of prosperity and functioning were replaced by the Dark Ages. At first it seemed like a trivial problem. People in their pride and ignorance did not pay much attention to the warning from the scouts. But after they started listening, it was too late. The mighty Drone Fleets have sprung from the emptiness of space to the edge of the Terminus sector. People have experienced the reality of vulnerability as hundreds of worlds have fallen under the onslaught of attacking drones. A mound was formed that encircled the center of the galaxy. The ruling parties decided that they did not intend to live in the middle of the galaxy that once ruled, so they sent fleets that were to drive out and destroy the drones and eventually return triumphantly. But that did not happen. The fleet returned reduced in half, and to this end, a danger began to form at the border of the Wildar and Eternity sectors, which the explorers spoke of as a horror that is better left alone. In a panic, the government sent the remaining half of the fleet back from the expedition to destroy the threat. However, the fleet did not return, and worse, it revolted and established a Syndicate that tried to fight the drones, and the government. This failure contributed to the catastrophe that was to come. The horror was the Fortress, which contained the command protocols of all the drones and the ability to form mobile factories and complexes to produce the new generation of drones known today as ancient drones. A fleet of drones, estimated at up to one billion drones, launched an attack on the rampart. The incompetence and unstable background in wall politics caused by the plight of the three ruling families allowed the drones to quietly attack the center of the galaxy. the ruling families who fought against each other were three, Foralkan, Kavani and Lycentians. These families could not agree on a commanding structure. At this time, CoreSec was created and was given two tasks. The first was to clone the human race so that it could survive. The second was to close and delete from the location records and all gate information. They provided CoreSec with their genetic material to create these clones. Then they boarded ships that were to fly to another galaxy. However, their journey did not turn out well. In the system known today as the G-09, they were raided, and the subsequent overload of the gate generator caused an explosion that destroyed the gate itself but also the fleeing fleet. Today, the human race survives in the form of the Clones. However, another catastrophe is forming in space. Anomalies of mysterious material reeled by the crystal guards began to appear. However, it is not known whether they intend to attack or not, but if so, humanity will not do well"

        "content": "Zw0_C\nThe people who made the X-Structures and relating technology is us humans, in the form of an extinct race or unknown trace of ancestors.\nThe technology used by this faction/species is identical to our present one.\nLet me explain. Ancient turrets,rigs and subsystems can oddly fit and be used on modern ships without any issue(aside from exclusive size-based modules). This would normally be strange, since generally in sci-fi or reality it wouldn’t be this easily compatible unless another factor is involved. The factor is that we based our ships off them. This also applies to the other things you can fit. Otherwise how would you explain the coincidence that railguns and coilguns look identical and we also have Dread-tiered modules and weaponry that has equal footing as them?\nAs seen in the shipyard variant of the X-Structures, the ship wreckage inside the shipyard, when seen with toned down graphics, appears to have a docking port, and also circular shaped engines. We also use this technology, except we don’t use docking ports on small vessels like these. These ships have similar color schemes and design style which is not really far off if you could make an evolution chart from ancient ships to modern ships in an ascending manner.\nThe materials used does not play a huge part, but its very much possible the composition of materials in their ships should be about the same ratio as any equivalent vessel matching that unknown vessel’s size.\nDocking ports suggest that this unknown class of vessel could have docked at structures. The design of the docking port is the same if you could say that. The design is barely a change from ours, and its also present mostly at the centre of the vessel just like destroyers.\nIt should be noted that when we usually say ancient, it’s mostly us, but built a long time ago by some existing/dissolved power of humans. So this could hint at it being ancient human technology. However,alternatively,the meaning and purpose of the label “ancient” can vary. It doesn’t have to necessarily be ancient human, it could ancient alien or just Extra-Terrestrial(E.T) technology that has been confirmed to be very old. But the points i mention somewhat refute this alternate claim."

        "title": "The Starscape Storyline",
        "content": "(Sparkstorm2010)\nAfter piecing together lots of hints and lore I have come up with the best theory I could about the Starscape storyline. \nIt began over 10,000 years ago when the human race entered the system that starscape is set in, they began by building stations on the rings of planets and they slowly moved closer into the center of the galaxy. The humans came in 2 groups, each from different earth civilisations, they both came on different sides of the galaxy, one was known as the Kavani, the other known as the Lycentians. At the time these 2 factions were allied with each other and worked to build more stations on the rings. As they moved closer in their stations became more advanced, and they began to build the stations we know today. To gather the materials for these stations they used an army of drones made by their mechanics to harvest resources and fight off pirates who attempted to destroy them for resources. Everyone was going fine until, disaster struck. Almost all the drones were hacked by pirates attempting to destroy the factions and take all the resources. The civilisations sent their ships to try and cut the drones off from leaving the galaxy at the gates that they entered the system via, and after a long fight at Gate 9, they managed to cut them off. But in sending ships their, they left the old stations vulnerable, as the new ones have defensive guns to stop them from being destroyed. The drones that usually guard these stations began to fire at them, destroying almost all of them. All the few stations that were guarded by non hacked drones put their drones to maximum security, making them shoot everything that enters the area. These \"ancient drones\" will guard the untouched old stations forever. The civilisations then agreed to form Core-Sec, an organisation devoted to destroy the drones, and they build a new capital for the galaxy, the citadel. Around this time the syndicate popped up, formed by some of the pirates who the drones were fighting. Then, in Lycentia, a rebellion occurred, started by a general who had massive ambitions to be an emperor, and so the foralkan empire was formed. Kavani took this as their chance to take control of galaxy and attacked both the factions. Then, to try and continue industry during the chaos, the trade union to support the very few traders who still trade."

        "content": "(Soviet Catto)\nStarscape lore is long. \nPre Core Civilisations\nThere once was a civilisation, who lived long ago, before guardians, drones or our current species. Their homeworld was named Earth. It is located in what nowdays is Foralkan Empire, Harvest, Secure Belt line planet 4. Now, you might ask why if you search Earth up you cant find it on the starscape map? I'll explain. The first humans used eon-ships which took generations to hop from star to star. They quickly took over all of harvest and were multiplying like rats. They were faced with a overpopulation crisis which forced them to expand and expand. With so many people and so many minds, who knows what they could invent? Galaxy destroying weapons? rare minerals and ships?\nNo. There was a corporation called Earco Ind. (Earth coalition industrial sector) which made a groundbreaking acheivement, drones. They used their headquaters on earth to make drones and controller pods. Essentialy, people plugged themselves into the machine and autonomously controlled a drone. This quickly spread the economical sector as more and more miners were recruited. The neighbouring galaxies seeing earth's acheivements and skills invited them to the IGA (Inter Galactical Alliance) Earth gladly accepted. Years passed with no major news until one fateful day, the destroyer class ship was concepted. It needed a rare mineral only found in far flung corners of the galaxy. That rescource was extremly limited and the entire galaxy only had 200KG of it. It was crucial to the construction of destroyers and was utilized immideantly. That rescource was Vexnium.\nThe other members got jealous and asked earth to trade. Earth profusely declined so as punishment, the other factions sent in crystal guardians, the most advanced ships of the time. They hoarded the vexnium so earth went on strike causing the GIGW (Great Inter-Galactic War) which lead to the destruction of G-09. There were nine gates and each of them led to neighbouring galaxies. The leader of the alliance Yunavithon, was linked to the starscape galxy by G-09. They blew up the gate, quarantined the other systems in their galaxies and cut the spacelanes. As their last act of the war, they blew up the capital Earth. Due to the fact the HQ of Earco Ind was blown up, all the sentient beings could not escape their shells, the drones. They migrated to the edges of the galaxy constantly bombarding the gates but all hope was lost.\nThe Expansion Age\nIn the 1st Galactican Standard Year (year 0 started as the first colonial ship exited Concord) marked the beggining of the race we are. Quickly colonising the neighbouring systems Bastion, Triage, Sheild, Aegis and Guard. The first ships sent were all Eon-ships, meant for generations upon generations to slowly migrate towards other systems. Hence, the Eon ships not knowing much about their homeland started their own civilisations. After many generations, a groundbreaking technology was created. Only seen in Sci-Fi movies, warping/hyperdrive was always a fantasy. But now it had come true. This invention was like the wheel, an invention that no matter what you would come across. Once all the systems gained this technology, hell was unleashed. All this time the humans grew further and further apart until the year 12037, when a certain young man took initiative and became the one who settled their differences and finally brought peace. This was a golden age for the Core, and together in teamwork and friendship set up the first station in the Citadel, a hub for all their systems.\nAfter many more eons, the relatively isolationist core had slowly emerged out of their shell and started colonising and discovering other systems. This process was further boosted by the cloning technology that led to even faster colonialization. Soon, their warp technology was so good that the MKII version of the warp could travel between systems in 2 months! But, there was far more danger ahead. They had discovered the drones, which mistook them for the enemies that blew their home planet up, became enraged and started massacring the colonies. After a few decades of war, the Core systems finally emerged victorious, banishing the drones away from the inner core. They also founded the organisation COR-SEC which defended the people from the incursions of drones. The drones also started adapting, and making new drones too. \nAfter the victory, Cor-Sec started a initiative to expand further and to create a Vassal-like body. It was compulsory for many citizens but not everyone was happy going away from their homes to a far-away wasteland. Some escaped and lived off alien planets while hiding from the drones. One such of these groups was the Kavans. They migrated west to a system called Vanos. The aliens there were quite similar to humans thus creating a new species called Kavani Humans. They stayed quiet, beliving in a Mandate sent from heaven that protected them from all enemies. That was the First Mandate. Some other groups went out and became pirates, hateful of Cor-Sec and tempted by the rewards. The colony eventually outgrew Cor-Sec and became the Lycentinian Federation.\nSoon after, the Lycentinians declared its independance from Cor-Sec and achieved full autonomy. With this new power, they started to expand at a high rate. Soon, they were encroaching on Kavani territory, not knowing they were there. This outraged the population, and one ambitious young man changed that. Beliving the heavens gave them a second mandate, giving them more territory. The Kavani's left their shell and started manufacturing ships for what they belived 'The Purge' would happen. It did.\nThe Lycentinians declared war on the Kavani Mandate causing turmoil across both nations. Sensing instability, the young Foralkus the First, Head of the South Front and leader of the Hippa Vassal State, declared independance under Kavani cover. The Lycentinians were overwhelmed and the Foralkans achieved their independance.\nAlthough the Kavani-Foralkan alliance did not last, and all three nations broke out in war, this was a relatively peaceful time. A group of rich pirates decided to start their own enterprice, called the Syndicate while setting up base in wild space, far far away from Cor-Sec's grasp. This immensly powerful Faction was not one of war, but one of Economy. They sold rare Spice (kinda like britain) and earned a buck load of money. Attempting to combat this, Cor-Sec setup a Secure based Faction called the Trade Union. The two companies fought limb to limb and toe to toe to get more profit than the other. This, helped the entire galaxy to rise in power and economy.\nPresent\nNow, as more citizens are being allowed by Cor-Sec to start going into space and earning money, the economy is thriving better than ever. As a symbol of prosperity, Cor-Sec rebuilt the Citadel station into a trading enterprise like we've never seen before. It had 3 levels, one for ships and factions to base in, one for refining and one purely built for socialisation and trading.\nCor-Sec has started one of many projects, to further enhance the economy and take advantage of the Wild's rescources has started building hyperjump lanes which propell you several systems at a time. The factions also made their own private wild mining sectors to one up each other. \nFuture\nOne day, us players can afford to start our own stations, one which we could base our faction in to get more power and grip of this constantly changing galaxy. Maybe one day we could discover even better technologies and better ships. Maybe one day we would be invited to the Inter-Galactical Alliance again. Who knows?\nYesterday is history. Tommorow is a mystery, and today is a gift. That's why they call it a present. - Oogway\nuhm, they actually call it present not a present! -Nerd"

This way, humanity could survive and potentially quadrillions of people would be born and diffuse across the galaxy, thanks to the efforts of this group.\nI believe a wormhole would have done it because we don’t necessarily know how to map another galaxy with our current technology, and our galaxy mainly has estimates.

This ancient civilisation expanded large and far, all over the charted and uncharted Starscape galaxy, and this may have been the first civilisation to inhabit the galaxy. However, with the drones also being shown as fairly old in historical terms (especially with the existence of Ancient Drones), a theory may be made about the drones being the same age of this ancient civilisation, and possibly what caused the apparent extinction of this civilisation. Now, how exactly would drones even emerge to cause something on this scale? Well, this theory states that drones were actually a scientific invention created by the ancient civilisation, likely for automation and resource collection. However, everything changed when the drones were also programmed to reproduce, in drone depots. As drones became more intelligent overtime due to their programming, they came to learn how to create drone depots, and created more across the galaxy, including foundries, factories, and megacomplexes. At this point, drones were more powerful than the ancient civilisation that created them, and thus they rebelled, sparking an ancient war between the two. This likely led to mass panic and pandemonium admist the ancient civilisation, leading to many attempting to escape through the Galactic Gates (G-01 through to G-09). As the war continued, drones learned of the position of one of these gates - G-09, and ended up destroying three ships whilst a crew was attempting to escape, destroying the Gate as well as the ships of the Blade of Perseus, Blue Space, and Singularity. As can be seen from the wreckage of G-09, the Blade of Perseus' crew can be seen, and their armor and body shape resembles humans, possibly meaning that this ancient civilisation was humanoid in some way, and originated from a habitable planet inside of the galaxy. Despite this, they ended up almost entirely losing the war, with only a small fraction of systems being secure, the Core systems of the Citadel, Guard, Aegis, Concord, Bastion, Triage, and Shield. After maintaining these systems and protecting them from the drones, CoreSEC was founded to be humanity's last stand against drones, and they ended up slowly covering the Inner Core. After this, it is possible that the two older military factions, the Lycentian Federation and the Kavani Mandate formed, although their origins as either ex-CoreSEC members or seperate species of humanoids is unclear, as both of their capitals are habitable planets."

Many people died, even more people were left without a place to call home after the abandonement and pillagement of the X-structures. There were two major leagues afterwards: those who wanted to restore humanity's power through organisation and unity (later known as CoreSec), and those who wanted to use the chaos that had erupted for their own good. \nBoth of these factions started off as small groups of people who tried to spread their ideology further and further. The first of two groups had more resources, since they most likely were major political/military figures, which had more power than ordinary people. At some point, they've had a breakthrough in cloning technology, using their services to further fund their operations. They came together and started slowly pushing drones away from the center of the galaxy, and the very fist space station that they've built by themselves was at that very center. They've named it \"The Citadel\". \nAfter a bit of time, however, it became more and more clear that drones weren't the only problem they had to face. The latter of the two groups described, later known as the Pirates, have also started to unite and gain power. They didn't have the resources of the people behind the newly-formed organisation, so they were forced to use more primitive measures, such as making their space stations and bases out of asteroids. That is also the reason most of their ships can be seen in a much worse state than their brand new, well-maintained counterparts. Those ships have started to decay due to the disrepair and mistreatment they were forced to endure, and thus, have started to lose performance and look like rust buckets. But it doesn't mean that the pirates aren't a threat. Although they didn't have quality, the sheer number of their ships that was left over from the remains of the civilization made them a formidable and risky opponent to fight. \nAs CoreSec continued to push drones back and gain power and people from doing so, pirates have become more and more frequent, as they remained on the outskirts of the galaxy, reinforcing their positions in the wild and unsecure systems. After some point, CoreSec deemed the recovery and stabilization of the entire galaxy unnecesary and expensive, both in terms of resources and lives, so they've instead focused on keeping whatever they had already captured. And that brings us to today, with solar systems close to the center being safe and peaceful, and the outskirts being the battlegrounds of the drones and pirates."
