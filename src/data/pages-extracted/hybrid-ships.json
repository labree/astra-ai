  "full_text": "Hybrid Ships\nHybrid ships are the most powerful fighters and interceptors in-game, and serve as rare and expensive trophy ships for endgame players. There are 4 hybrid ships; the Hybrid Claymore, the Hybrid Luminar, the Hybrid Polaris, and the Hybrid Paragon. \nCrafting\nHybrid ships require the advanced version of the fighter (i.e. you need a Luminar to craft a Hybrid Luminar), 100 power cells, a Drone Command Core, 2 Vexnium, and the respective Hybrid blueprint. Each Hybrid Fighter takes 1 hour to craft. To obtain Hybrid Ship Blueprints, kill Elite or Command Drone corvettes, frigates, destroyers, and cruisers, or destroy Drone Battleships. The exact drop rate is unknown, but it is known to be very low.\nDrone Battleships are popular targets for pilots who want a Hybrid ship, because they usually drop many Hybrid items and blueprints.\nTrivia\nBefore the Next Gen update, Hybrid ships used to be called as X-Ships.\nX-Ships used to be much harder to craft as they required 2 BPs to be crafted(with the advanced ship and red narcor). These blueprints are labelled with “1/2” and “2/2”, where you would need to get both of them. The blueprint’s rarity made them expensive, and in turn made the crafted ship very pricey to purchase. The two blueprints both had a large price difference due to the possible drop rate difference back then.\nThe Paragon-X(Now Hybrid Paragon) was the most sought after X-Ship for PVP, with Polaris being in second. However after the Next Gen update came, the Hybrid Paragon usage rate fell as other Hybrid ships with the revamped Rig and Module system made the Paragon less effective in being a PVP ship. Nowadays, it sees limited usage, and something more like a VIP or fancy ship.\nX-Ships used to have a dark color scheme with glowing yellow stripes, but this was changed to a more lighter color but with the same glowing stripes(unless the skin applied changes it) to make it easier to be seen and visible.",
